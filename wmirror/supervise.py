"""The detached supervisor that owns one wl-mirror process.

The detaching, the status pipe and the /proc identity checks are w11common.procs -- the same protocol the gamma
holder runs on, written once and documented there.

One thing the holder does not have: the thing we spawn is not us, it is wl-mirror. So the record carries TWO
(pid, starttime) pairs. If our supervisor is killed the helper is still found and stopped by `wmirror --stop`;
if the helper dies on its own the supervisor exits and the record is reaped on the next `--list`.

The supervisor is what makes the mirror end honestly. It watches the output layout over zwlr_output_management
(the protocol wxrandr already speaks) and kills the helper when its source or target goes away, is switched off,
or the two come to share pixels -- the geometry in which wl-mirror would capture its own picture. wl-mirror
itself only handles the first of those: it exits when the SOURCE disappears, and it happily survives the target
disappearing, which on sway relocates the mirror window onto the source.

#: the helper in 2-4 ms, so this budget is not spent -- but only because

#: `--list` and `--stop` find our own supervisor by name only when the

#: command line, and the command line is the half that matters: the process
#: is `python3` in every shape it ships in (a clone, a pyz, `python3 -m
#: wmirror`), so comm says "python3" and only the argv says "wmirror".
#: "python" used to be in this tuple, which made a `'?'` record claim every
#: python process this user was running -- a bystander `python3 -c "import
#: time; time.sleep(30)"` answered alive, and `--stop-all` would have
#: SIGTERMed it.
