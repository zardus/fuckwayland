"""Detection, policy, output model and the wl-mirror argv.

wmirror drives the external `wl-mirror` -- an unprivileged wlroots
screen-copy client, packaged in Ubuntu universe -- and owns its lifetime.
It exists for the two pictures output geometry alone cannot produce on
wlroots (both measured on sway 1.11, see docs/WMIRROR.md):

  * a REGION of one output shown on another: no layout expresses it;
  * a whole output shown on a differently-shaped one: two outputs sharing a
    position show the same pixels, but the smaller one CROPS -- wlroots'
    zwlr_output_management has no replication request to fix that the way
    KWin's set_replication_source does.

Everything else stays where it was. Two outputs of the same logical size at
the same position already mirror on sway, byte-identical, with no helper at
all, so wmirror refuses that case by name and points at `wxrandr --same-as`.

wmirror never changes an output. It starts a client window and watches it.
