# .github/workflows/ci.yml run before vm/live-smoke.sh.

#
# A golden is keyed by the sha256 of everything that goes into building it (the flavor
# yaml, vm/vmctl, the three build scripts, and vm/golden-epoch, a file to bump by hand
# when the upstream cloud image or ISO has moved under an unchanged recipe) and kept as
# an OCI artifact at ghcr.io/<owner>/w11-golden/<flavor>:<key>, pushed with oras.
# On a hit it is pulled into $VMDATA/golden/<flavor>.qcow2 in about a minute; on a miss
# the base image or ISO is downloaded into $VMIMAGES, the golden is built the way
# vm/README.md says (vmctl build, build-iso-golden.sh for an ISO flavor, or
# build-nixos-golden.sh for a `# vmctl-nix:` one), flattened and compressed into a
# standalone qcow2 (no backing file, so the cache does not depend on a path), and pushed
# for the next run.  A `# vmctl-nix:` flavor is the exception at both ends: its image has
# the rig's root key baked in, so it is neither pulled nor pushed -- see the paragraph
# above `cacheable=1` below.
#
#   GOLDEN_REPO   the OCI repository prefix (default ghcr.io/<GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER>/w11-golden)
