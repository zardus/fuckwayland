"""Do the documents, the help text and the code agree?

Prose read against prose catches nothing: every contradiction this project has
shipped was between a document and a *fact* -- an option parser, an install
file, an import.  So this reads the options out of the source, reads what each
tool prints when it is run, reads what the documents claim, and reports where
the three disagree.

Everything it reports is meant to be a real disagreement.  A finding that is
deliberate belongs in one of the two tables below, with the reason written
down, and the tables are themselves checked: an entry that has stopped being
true is a finding too, so a table cannot quietly rot into an excuse.

  python3 scripts/check-docs.py            # everything
  python3 scripts/check-docs.py --tool wxrandr
  python3 scripts/check-docs.py --grep overlap    # one feature across everything
  python3 scripts/check-docs.py --list           # every option, and where it is documented

Exit status is 1 when anything is reported.
