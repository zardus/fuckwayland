# live-smoke.d/kde.sh -- Plasma 6.6 on Wayland (KWin 6.6.6), resolute-kde.
#
# Measured 2026-09-08, package route, nothing else installed: wdotool
# search/move/size/activate/getactivewindow, wwmctl -l/-d and the maximize pair
# (restore exact), wxprop WM_CLASS and _NET_WM_STATE, type, mousemove+click all
# correct; wxrandr --off/--auto prints KWin's "applies and saves this layout
# immediately" notice plus the exact restore command line; the live-layout read
# reports "group 2 of 2, from wayland + kwin" and types
# `[1] yz@ Straße | [0] yz@ Strae |` -- ß skipped on US with the documented
# warning, byte-exact, under ONE running daemon.
#
# There is no bridge, no overlap route and no monitors.xml here, so those phases
# are simply not in the list; `kwin` is this desktop's own extra phase (T60).

# `dm` is the one phase that is here for a distro rather than for Plasma:
# Fedora 44 replaced SDDM with plasma-login-manager in every KDE variant, and
# vm/build-image.sh's dm_plasma writes one autologin file or the other by which
# one the packages created.  Which one actually seated the session is a thing
# only the guest can say.

# The greeter that logged the session in, from logind's own record of it.
# The regex is a PREFIX and not `^sddm$` on purpose: what was measured is
# `Service=sddm-autologin` on the SDDM-autologin guest of the openbox recon
# [recon2/openbox 97, `loginctl show-session 1` -> Service=sddm-autologin
# Type=x11], because autologin's PAM service carries the suffix.  No live-smoke
# log in vm/live-smoke.out/ carries a Service line at all -- the three noble-kde
# runs predate this phase -- so Ubuntu's Plasma being seated by sddm is a `want`
# on that recon and on nothing else.  Fedora 44 is seated by plasmalogin.service
# instead, whose autologin keys were read out of the plasma-login-manager rpm's
# /etc/plasmalogin.conf template and never run [recon2/fedora 5], so that half
# is an `xwant` until the first fedora44-kde golden builds and says XPASS.
