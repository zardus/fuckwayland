# live-smoke.d/wayfire.sh -- Wayfire 0.10.0 (resolute-wayfire), the JSON-IPC path.
#
# The second compositor family that needs no privilege for anything, and the only one in the rig whose
# ORACLE is independent of the protocol under test: `window-rules/list-outputs` is Wayfire's own view of its
# outputs, where wlr-randr and wxrandr's wlr backend are two clients of one zwlr_output_manager_v1.  oracle.py
# reads the IPC first and falls back to wlr-randr; the display phase prints both.
#
# Every check below was measured on 2026-09-08 against wayfire 0.10.0-1 -- the exact package this flavor
# installs -- run headless on the dev box with the rig's own plugin list (WLR_BACKENDS=headless,
# WLR_RENDERER=pixman, tests/support.py:HeadlessWayfire).  What that run cannot show is the three things a
# real seat owns: logind flipping the session Type to wayland, wf-panel painting, and /dev/uinput being
# there -- which is what this file exists to find out.  It has since found out: two live runs on the
# golden, 53/0/1 on 2026-09-08 and 58/0/1 on 2026-09-09 (instance wf1, two heads, the 0.4.0 deb), and the
# numbers this file cites as "live" are the second one's.
#
# Wayfire FLOATS by default (no tiling plugin in the stock list), so unlike sway.sh nothing here is skipped
# for being a tiling window manager: move, size, minimize, the maximize pair and the nine viewports are all
# claims the tool makes and all of them are checked.  What is NOT exact is the window SIZE: a terminal
# commits the nearest whole character cell, so `windowsize 800 600` on foot came back 798x598 and
# `wwmctl -e 0,10,20,300,200` came back 300x195 (measured).  The POSITION is exact to the pixel here, so the
# size is checked to within one cell and the position byte for byte.
#
# X11 gives no single number to be byte-equal to either, which is why the tolerance is a tolerance and not a
# literal: `xdotool windowsize 800 600` on an xterm (Ubuntu's /usr/bin/xdotool, Xvfb :98 on this box,
# 2026-09-08) read back 800x600 under no window manager and under xfwm4, and 796x589 under openbox and
# marco, because those two honour the WM_NORMAL_HINTS resize increments the terminal sets.  Position under a
# reparenting WM moved too (100,100 asked, 102,140 read back under openbox).  The rounding is the window
# manager's business on X and the client's on Wayland, and both sides of that fork fit inside one cell.

# Wayfire's own IPC, as a ONE-LINE question from the guest: int32-LE length + JSON both ways, the framing
# oracle.py already speaks.  Used to cross-read what the tools say against what the compositor thinks --
# never to make anything happen.  Five reads happen over a run, in this order:
# `window-rules/get_cursor_position` (twice: before anything has warped the pointer and after the warp),
# `window-rules/get-focused-output`, `window-rules/list-outputs outputs` and `wayfire/get-keyboard-state`.
#
# One line and NOT a heredoc, though a heredoc reads better: guest-capture.sh's `run` echoes `### <command>`
# and then the command's output, so a heredoc's body would be recorded as bytes off the compositor, and
# tests/fixtures/live/README.md says a transcript carries nothing written by hand.  One line per method also
# gives fake-vmctl a distinct key per read (its norm() collapses whitespace and strips the trailing pipes),
# so replay does not depend on three different questions sharing one prefix and coming back in the order
# they were recorded; only the two get_cursor_position reads share a key, and take() walks those in order.
# Whoever records this flavor runs the same five commands: an unrecorded one is answered with empty and
# status 0, which turns the `same` checks red in selftest-offline's first pass.  The two list-outputs reads
# differ only by that trailing `outputs` word, and answer() tries the exact key before its longest-prefix
# fallback -- so a recording that has the JSON read and not the `outputs` one makes the display check red
# rather than quietly agreeing with itself.  Proven over the transcript of the 2026-09-09 live run
# (scratchpad/b13r/): 49 checks green in pass 1, and nine one-value mutations each turning exactly one red.
