# live-smoke.d/mate.sh -- MATE 1.26 on marco over Xorg (resolute-mate), the only session Ubuntu has.
#
# The handover body is Xfce's, unchanged, for the reason kde-x11.sh gives: handing our argv to the real
# xdotool/wmctrl/xprop/xrandr is a property of the SESSION TYPE and not of the desktop.  What this file
# adds is what marco is and nobody else is:
#
#   * `marco`.  marco is Metacity's fork and answers `Metacity (Marco)` on the _NET_SUPPORTING_WM_CHECK
#     window, with 68 atoms in _NET_SUPPORTED -- `_NET_WM_STATE_SHADED` among them, which mutter dropped
#     and KWin 6 refuses.  Its check window carries no _NET_WM_PID and no WM_CLASS, and
#     _NET_SHOWING_DESKTOP is absent right after start, so real `wmctrl -m` prints THREE N/A columns
#     here where xfwm4 prints a class, a pid and OFF.  That is what a MATE user sees, so it is asserted
#     as the answer and not as a defect [M recon2/mate.md 1, 3, against marco 1.26.2 under Xvfb].
#   * `heads`.  mate-settings-daemon's xrandr plugin is the one MATE-specific rig risk the recon could
#     not settle without a VM: `org.mate.SettingsDaemon.plugins.xrandr
#     turn-on-external-monitors-at-startup` is FALSE by default and vm/build-image.sh's desktop_mate
#     does not write it, so a head that is unplugged and plugged back in may stay disabled
#     [M recon2/mate.md 5].  This phase is that measurement.
#   * `x11root`.  common.sh's phase_root is a Wayland claim (root over ssh finds the seated user's
#     session), and xfce.sh's own comment says the X11 half is "a separate measurement nobody has made".
#     Here it is, on the desktop whose mechanism gap was measured: with the stock _SESSION_LEADERS
#     `_shell_environ(1000)` answered {} and with `mate-session` added it answered DISPLAY=:91
#     [M recon2/mate.md 4].  Whether LightDM's ~/.Xauthority masks the gap on a real box is exactly what
#     this phase settles.
#
# The window every check acts on is xfce.sh's `xterm -T w11smoke`: `wwmctl -lGpx` byte-identical to
# `wmctrl -lGpx` was measured on an xterm on a MATE session [M recon2/mate.md 3], and mate-terminal --
# which ubuntu-mate-desktop puts on the image -- has a VTE geometry that nothing here needs.
