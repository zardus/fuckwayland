# live-smoke.d/sway.sh -- sway 1.11 (resolute-sway), the protocol path.
#
# Measured 2026-09-08, package route: wxrandr --listmonitors and --off/--auto,
# `wwmctl -d` showing the three per-output workspaces, a foot window found by
# class with geometry/activate correct, `type` arriving byte-exact through
# uinput AND through `--vkbd on` (no privilege), set_desktop/get_desktop
# switching workspaces, mouse and wxprop correct.
#
# There is no bridge, no monitors.xml and no portal here at all -- which is why
# the phase list is the short one and why the observation this file keeps is an
# ORDERING one: `wxrandr --listmonitors` lists Virtual-3, Virtual-2, Virtual-1
# (sway's get_outputs order) where xrandr would list in output order.  Harmless,
# and a parity nit for scripts that index monitors by position.
#
# The same file, unchanged, is what fedora44-sway (sway 1.11 on Fedora 44),
# arch-sway (1:1.12) and nixos-sway (1.12) run.  All six tools were measured
# identical on all three before any of those flavors existed -- the protocol
# path is a compositor property and none of these distros moves a socket, a
# global or a version string [recon2/fedora 3.1, recon2/arch 3.1, recon2/nixos].
# What does differ is what is INSTALLED beside sway: Arch's archive carries
# xdotool 4.20260303.1, the exact version the parity oracle compares against,
# and Fedora's carries 3.20211022.1 like Ubuntu's [recon2/arch 2, recon2/fedora 7].
# Neither changes a check here; both are why arch-sway is the flavor the
# parity job runs on.

# No text editor on this golden: the "editor" is a terminal running `cat`, which
# is exactly how the hand measurement read the typed bytes back -- the shell's
# line discipline flushes a line per Return, so `editor_save` is a Return.
#
# `cat >>` and not `cat >`: editor_clear truncates the file, and a descriptor
# opened without O_APPEND keeps its offset across a truncation -- the next line
# typed would land at the old offset behind a run of NULs, which bash then drops
# from $(...) with a warning, so the comparison would pass by accident on a file
# that is garbage.  O_APPEND makes the write after a truncate land at offset 0.

# sway tiles, and the hand measurement on resolute-sway measured exactly this
# much: "foot window found by class, geometry, activate; set_desktop/get_desktop
# switch workspaces; mouse and wxprop correct".  windowmove/windowsize on a
# TILED window are ignored by the compositor, windowminimize has no meaning in a
# tiling layout, and the maximize pair was never measured here -- so the two
# common phases are overridden with the measured subset rather than run whole
# and left to fail on claims nobody has made.  (The floating alternative,
# `swaymsg '[app_id=foot] floating enable'` before the geometry steps, would
# measure a different window manager state than the one that was measured.)
