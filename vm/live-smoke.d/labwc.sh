# live-smoke.d/labwc.sh -- labwc 0.9.3 on wlroots 0.19.2, and with it the whole generic
# wlroots floor.
#
# Four flavors run this file: resolute-labwc (bare labwc under greetd), resolute-budgie and
# resolute-xfce-wayland and resolute-lxqt-wayland (three shipped desktops whose Wayland
# session IS labwc, each of which sources this file and overrides its terminal).  What they
# share is the thing worth measuring: labwc has no IPC socket at all -- the package is labwc,
# labnag and lab-sensible-terminal and nothing else -- so detection lands on WlrBackend and
# wxrandr's `wlr` backend, and every check below runs through the GENERIC code
# [recon2/labwc 1, 4].  resolute-sway, the only other wlroots image, takes the sway IPC
# backend instead and so has never exercised a line of it.
#
# Every claim here is a byte the recon measured against a real headless labwc 0.9.3
# [recon2/labwc, recon2/budgie, recon2/xfce-wayland, recon2/openbox B] or a string the unit
# tests pin (tests/test_backend_wlr.py, tests/test_backend_wlr_workspaces.py,
# tests/test_labwc_live.py).  What NOBODY has run is this file: no golden of any of the four
# flavors exists yet, so tests/fixtures/live/ carries no labwc recording and NOT-YET-RUN says
# so for all four tokens.
#
# The floor as it was, before batch 8, on one headless labwc with an xterm and a foot:
#
#   $ wwmctl -lGpx
#   0x000f4240 -1 0      0    0    1280 720  xterm.xterm    fuckwayland xtermwin
#   0x000f4241 -1 0      0    0    1280 720  foot.foot      fuckwayland footwin
#   $ wwmctl -d
#   get_desktop is not supported by the wlr backend                              (rc 1)
#
# while that xterm's real X id was 0x40000c and the X server's own WM_CLASS for it was
# "xterm", "XTerm".  A same-compositor control settled that this is the backend and not
# labwc: on ONE headless sway 1.11, the same foot window read `0x00000005 0 85920` through
# the sway backend and `0x000f4240 -1 0` under WDOTOOL_BACKEND=wlr [recon2/labwc 3].  Three
# of those columns are what this file measures the fix of; the fourth (geometry for native
# windows) has no request in the protocol and is NOT YET -- the lowest route that would give
# it is AGENTS.md route 5, ConfigureWindow over the X plane for XWayland windows only, which
# would leave a listing where half the windows can be moved, so it needs a decision before it
# needs code [recon2/labwc 6c].
#
# The one capability labwc has that sway 1.11 has not: ext_workspace_manager_v1 v1 (and
# zcosmic_workspace_manager_v1 v1), where `wayland-info | grep -cE "ext_workspace|zcosmic_workspace"`
# on sway 1.11 in the same guest printed 0 [recon2/labwc 2].  vm/build-image.sh's labwc_config
# writes three desktops named 1, 2 and 3 into ~/.config/labwc/rc.xml precisely so that this
# file has something to count.
#
# `mirror` is in the phase list because labwc advertises BOTH capture protocols --
# zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1 v3 and ext_image_copy_capture_manager_v1 v1 -- and `wmirror
# --check` listed both and started and stopped a region mirror in the recon [recon2/labwc 3].
# `nodialog` is trivially true here and cheap: this session runs no xdg-desktop-portal at all
# (no org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop on the bus, measured on the Xfce variant
# [recon2/xfce-wayland 1]).

# labwc has no IPC and no D-Bus surface, so there is no second opinion about a NATIVE window
# anywhere on this desktop -- which is the honest reason phase_windows below asserts the
# floor's own numbers rather than a compositor's.  For XWayland windows there IS one, and it
# is the real X server: `xprop` and `wmctrl` are installed on every one of these goldens.

# The X id of the one X client whose WM_CLASS instance is $1, as the REAL xprop reports it.
# Read through xprop and not through wxprop: wxprop -root goes through the same X connection
# our own views() uses, and an oracle sharing the code under test asserts nothing.
