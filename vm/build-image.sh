# vmctl guest-side golden-image build.  NOT run on the host: vmctl embeds this
# file into the flavor's cloud-init user-data (write_files -> /usr/local/sbin/
# vmctl-build) and cloud-init runs it once, as root, inside the build VM.
# Progress lines ("vmctl-build: ...") and the final markers go to the serial
# console so `vmctl build` can follow them and decide success.
#
# Three layers, because the rig is no longer Ubuntu-only:
#   pkg_*      one implementation per package manager, chosen from /etc/os-release
#              ID (ID_LIKE as the fallback).  The yaml never says which: the guest
#              knows what it is, so a flavor header cannot lie to it.
#   dm_*       one per display manager, taking the session name or the command.
#   desktop_*  the quiet-desktop settings, first-run suppression and the per-head
#              layout contract (head 0 = Virtual-1 at (0,0)) of one desktop.
# The `case "$DESKTOP"` at the bottom is a dispatch table with one line per
# `# vmctl-desktop:` token of vm/vmctl's DESKTOPS, and nothing else
# (tests/test_vm_scripts.py R04 pins the two against each other).
#
# Every file the dm_*/desktop_* layers write is remembered for relabel(): by wcat
# (which writes and records in one) or, for the three configs built out of a group
# redirection, by a written() call beside it.  On Fedora SELinux is Enforcing and a
# file written by cloud-init's runcmd carries whatever label that process had
# [recon2/fedora, recon2/pkg-rpm].
# $VMCTL_ROOT prefixes every path a dm_*/desktop_* touches; it is empty in the
# guest and a temp tree in the tests (R03).
#
# Inputs (written by the flavor yaml to /etc/vmctl-build.env):
#   FLAVOR       flavor name (also the hostname)
#   DESKTOP      a DESKTOPS key of vm/vmctl (default gnome): which display manager
#                and desktop set-up below applies
#   DESKTOP_PKG  the desktop metapackage(s), e.g. ubuntu-desktop, or
#                "kubuntu-desktop plasma-workspace-wayland"; on dnf a word ending
#                in -environment is a comps environment id, not a package
#   EXTRA_PKGS   test-support packages (real X tools for parity oracles)
