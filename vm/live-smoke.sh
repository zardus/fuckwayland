# live-smoke.sh -- the hand smoke of 2026-09-08, scripted, one flavor per run.
#
# Everything this checks was measured by hand first, on this rig, on
# noble-gnome (GNOME Shell 46.0), resolute-gnome (50.1), stonking-gnome
# (51.beta / libmutter-51.so.0), resolute-kde (Plasma 6.6 / KWin 6.6.6) and
# resolute-sway (sway 1.11); the write-up of that session is the oracle every
# step here replays.  A step that disagrees with it prints `FAIL <what>` with
# the bytes it actually saw, and the script's exit status is the number of
# FAILs (capped at 125, since a shell status is a byte and 126/127/128+ mean
# other things).  A run that cannot even get a desktop exits 2.
#
#   usage: vm/live-smoke.sh <flavor> [options]
#
#     --name NAME     instance name (default <flavor>-smoke)
#     --reuse         reuse the existing instance and whatever is installed in
#                     it; skips start --fresh and the install phase.  This is
#                     the iteration mode -- gnome46/gnome50/kde66/sway1 already
#                     carry a package -- and NOT the mode a release is measured
#                     in
#     --pkg           install the DISTRIBUTION PACKAGE and nothing else (the
#                     packaging axis).  Which package is decided by the flavor's
#                     `# vmctl-distro:` header, never by this script's own idea
#                     of what the guest is:
#                       ubuntu  release/fuckwayland_<ver>_all.deb
#                       fedora  $LIVE_SMOKE_RPMS/*.rpm -- default dist/, where
#                               scripts/build-rpm.sh leaves the three noarch
#                               rpms, and where the CI `rpm` job's artifact is
#                               unpacked
#                       arch    $LIVE_SMOKE_PKG -- default
#                               dist/fuckwayland-<ver>-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
#                       nixos   nothing is copied in: the package IS the image,
#                               and phase install asserts the store path and the
#                               specialisation instead
#     --deb           the older spelling of --pkg.  Kept because every note,
#                     log and habit in this tree predates Fedora and Arch
#     --heads N       monitors (default 2; the display and overlap phases need
#                     two, the layout phases do not care)
#     --cpus N        vCPUs (default 2)   } this host runs seven other agents
#     --mem M         guest RAM (default 3G)
#     --phases a,b,c  run only these, in this order (see --list-phases)
#     --skip a,b      run the default list without these
#     --list-phases   print the flavor's default phase list and exit
#     --scale         re-run the display phase with scaling-factor 2 (the
#                     scale axis: 1.0 first, then 2 on the same instance)
#     --keep          leave the instance running at the end (default: stop it,
#                     because the memory rule on this host is ONE VM at a time)
#     --remove        after the phases, remove the package with the flavor's own
#                     package manager and check that every piece of it went: the
#                     files, the autostart symlink, the stamp, both extensions,
#                     and the grant on /dev/uinput.  Only meaningful with --pkg:
#                     the default mode installs the working tree over the
#                     package into /usr/local/bin, which no package manager owns
#
# The default mode (neither --pkg nor --deb) deploys the WORKING TREE over the
# package: scripts/build-pyz.sh into /usr/local/bin the way repro/deploy-to-vm.sh
# does, plus gnome/fuckwayland-bridge@fuckwayland over the package's copy,
# because the tree carries fixes the shipped package does not (b7a60f0's
# maximize pair among them).
#
# Results land in vm/live-smoke.out/<flavor>-<date>.log with a screenshot of
# every head per phase next to it in <flavor>-<date>-shots/.

# ------------------------------------------------------- the removal, last
# Removing the package is the other half of the packaging claim and the half
# nobody ever runs: README.Debian says removing it puts /dev/uinput back to
# root:root 0600 with no ACL, and until this existed that sentence had been
# checked by reading debian/fuckwayland.postrm.  It runs after every phase
# because it destroys the installation the phases measure, and only under
# --pkg: the default mode puts the tree's zipapps in /usr/local/bin, which no
# package manager owns and none will take away, so a removal there would report
# files left behind that were never the package's.
#
# What it asserts is what the hand smoke measured on resolute-gnome after
# `apt-get remove -y fuckwayland`: nothing of ours under the packaging's own
# libexec directory, no autostart entry, no /var/lib/fuckwayland stamp, neither
# extension directory, /dev/uinput back to root:root 0600 with no ACL entry and
# no uaccess tag -- and, because the remove drops the stamp, a re-install
# printing the first-install banner all over again.  The four packagings differ
# in exactly two of those: which paths they owned (pkg_left_behind) and whether
# they print a banner at all (pkg_banner_re).  The /dev/uinput half is
# identical everywhere and is the point: the rpm's %postun and pacman's
# post_remove run debian's revoke sequence token for token
# [recon2/pkg-rpm, recon2/pkg-arch].
