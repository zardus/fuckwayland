# NixOS publishes no cloud image at all -- the 26.05 release directory has two
# ISOs, nixexprs.tar.xz and nothing else [recon2/nixos §7.1] -- and NixOS runs
# no cloud-init, so the seed `vmctl start` attaches (vm/vmctl qemu_common) is
# read by nobody in the guest.  Everything cloud-init would have done is
# therefore baked into the image, and the root ssh key is the one thing that
# cannot be committed: it comes in through the environment, see rootKey below.
#
# Every option name here was verified against nixos-26.05 [recon2/nixos §7.2].
