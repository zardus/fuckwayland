# w11.spec -- the Fedora counterpart of debian/.
#
# An RPM of this tree is a translation, not a port: every payload path the .deb
# ships exists on Fedora under the same name (/usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
# <uuid>, /usr/lib/udev/rules.d, /usr/lib/modules-load.d, /etc/xdg/autostart),
# and the two dpkg maintainer scripts translate line for line into %post and
# %postun.  Measured 2026-09-08 on the Ubuntu 26.04 guest, which has the same
# rpm 6.0.1 Fedora 44 has: a portable variant of this file (the %%pyproject_*
# steps replaced by a hand copy, because those macros are Fedora-only and
# rpmbuild here dies at "%%pyproject_buildrequires: not found") built three
# noarch packages -- w11 556,673 B, -bridge 28,507 B, -overlap
# 32,388 B -- which installed into a scratch root and erased again leaving
# nothing under /usr or /etc but empty directories [recon2/pkg-rpm.md 4].
#
# Everything below that differs from debian/ differs for a measured reason and
# says which.  The first real build with the %%pyproject_* macros is the CI
# `rpm` job in fedora:44; tests/test_rpm_spec.py and tests/test_rpm_scripts.py
# hold every claim that can be held without rpmbuild.

# warandr is one tool of six and the only importer of gi.  Weak deps are on by
# default in dnf, so the GUI still arrives for everyone who has not turned them
# off, and `dnf install w11` on a sway box drags in no toolkit.  This is
# the deb's documented gap -- tests/test_release_deb.py TheGtkDependency, an
# expectedFailure -- taken the other way here; a divergence, and the owner's to
# settle (design decision 5).

# has x11-utils and x11-xserver-utils, so the hint names four packages and not
# two.  w11common/distro.py's fedora row is these same names, and

%description
Six commands that behave like the X11 tools they clone -- same commands, same
flags, same output bytes -- on a Wayland session:

  * wdotool  - xdotool: key/type/click/mousemove and the window commands
  * wwmctl   - wmctrl: list and act on windows, desktops and workspaces
  * wxprop   - xprop: properties of native and XWayland windows
  * wxrandr  - xrandr: query and reshape the monitor layout
  * warandr  - arandr: the drag-your-monitors GUI, on Wayland and on X11
  * wmirror  - mirror a region or an odd-shaped output on wlroots (wl-mirror)

On an X11 session the first four hand over to the real xdotool, wmctrl, xprop
and xrandr with execve, argv untouched, so one script runs on both session
types.  The originals are never replaced.

Also installed: a udev rule that lets the user at the active seat open
/dev/uinput without root, and the warandr application-menu entry.  The GNOME
Shell bridge extension the window commands need on GNOME is the
gnome-shell-extension-w11-bridge subpackage, which dnf installs
alongside this one on any machine that also has gnome-shell.

%package -n gnome-shell-extension-%{name}-bridge
Summary:        GNOME Shell extension exporting Mutter's window API on the session bus
Requires:       gnome-shell
Requires:       %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
# Installed automatically wherever both halves are present, and nowhere else.
# The .deb cannot express that: it carries the extension for every machine,
# sway boxes included.  Fedora's convention, measured against
# gnome-shell-extension-appindicator's file list [recon2/pkg-rpm.md 2].
Supplements:    (%{name} and gnome-shell)

%description -n gnome-shell-extension-%{name}-bridge
GNOME has no window-management protocol, so wdotool's window commands, wwmctl
and wxprop go through a small GNOME Shell extension that exports Mutter over
the session bus as org.w11.Bridge.  gnome-shell scans extension
directories only at login, so one log out and back in is needed after
installing this; the extension is enabled for each user in that first session
by /etc/xdg/autostart/w11-enable-bridge.desktop.

%package -n gnome-shell-extension-%{name}-overlap
Summary:        GNOME Shell extension for wxrandr --unsafe-gnome-overlap
Requires:       gnome-shell
Requires:       %{name} = %{version}-%{release}
# Deliberately NO Supplements: nothing installs this for you, nothing enables
# it, and it is the only thing here that can cost the session you are sitting
# in.  README.md, "Overlapping monitors on GNOME".

%description -n gnome-shell-extension-%{name}-overlap
The one route through Mutter's refusal to place two monitors so that they
share screen area.  Installing it turns nothing on: the two further steps are
`gnome-extensions enable %{overlap_uuid}` and
`wxrandr --unsafe-gnome-overlap`, and both refuse on a GNOME generation the
table has not measured.

# The bridge extension, its per-user enabler and the autostart entry that runs
# it.  Two differences from debian/ here, both deliberate:
#
#  * the helper is %%{_libexecdir}/w11/enable-bridge, not
#    /usr/lib/w11/enable-bridge, because /usr/libexec is where Fedora
#    puts a program no user runs by hand.  The script itself is unchanged; the
#    .desktop's Exec= is rewritten below, and that is the whole of the
#    difference.
#  * the .desktop is a plain file straight into %%{_sysconfdir}/xdg/autostart.
#    debhelper registers every regular file under /etc as a conffile and a
#    conffile survives `apt remove`, which is why debian/ installs it under
#    /usr/lib and symlinks it; rpm marks nothing %%config unless the spec says
#    so, so an erase takes the file and there is no symlink to arrange.

# on it.  The node stays root:root 0600 and no group is involved.
