"""X11 passthrough: on a plain X11 session, hand over to the real tool.

SHARED, frozen after landing (like `session.py` / `dbus_mini.py`): wire-level
fixes allowed, API changes need a note.

These tools are drop-in replacements *installed over* the originals
(`/usr/local/bin/xdotool` is us, `/usr/bin/xdotool` is the distribution's).
On Wayland that is the whole point. On a plain X11 session (Xfce, i3, MATE,
Cinnamon, LXQt/Openbox, GNOME/KDE on Xorg) it is a regression: the X server is
authoritative there and the originals have XTEST, the real property store and
real RandR, which we cannot beat from outside. Every desktop in that list was
measured on a live one; docs/Technical.md section 2 carries the same
enumeration and the numbers behind it. So on X11 we get out of the way and
`execve()` the original with the argv we were given.

Three parts:

* `session_kind()` — "wayland", "x11" or None. Wayland is tested *first*:
  `$DISPLAY` is set on a Wayland session too (Xwayland), so it is never
  evidence of an X11 session, while a live Wayland socket of *our* session is
  conclusive. The rest of the order exists for sudo / `ssh root@` / cron, where
  the environment says nothing or lies.
* `real_tool()` — the next binary of that name on PATH that is not us, with
  four independent "not us" guards plus one that is guaranteed to terminate.
* `maybe_exec_real()` — the handover itself: default SIGPIPE/SIGXFSZ, flush,
  `os.execve` (never `subprocess`: exit status, signal death, the controlling
  terminal and the process group all survive for free), plus the environment
  repair that makes `sudo xdotool key a` work *through* us where the original
  alone fails.

Environment:

* `FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH=never|always|auto` (per-tool: `WDOTOOL_PASSTHROUGH`,
  `WWMCTL_PASSTHROUGH`, `WXPROP_PASSTHROUGH`, `WXRANDR_PASSTHROUGH`).
  `never` = run our own code whatever the session (the test suite and
  developers on an X11 laptop); `always` = hand over whatever the session.
  Both are about the *handover*, so a caller that never hands over ignores
  them (`warandr`: `session_kind(respect_override=False)`).
* `WDOTOOL_REAL_XDOTOOL`, `WWMCTL_REAL_WMCTRL`, `WXPROP_REAL_XPROP`,
  `WXRANDR_REAL_XRANDR` — the original's path, skipping the PATH walk.
* `_FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH` (private) — the recursion stop. It carries the
  realpaths we have already handed over to; a process that finds *itself* in
  that list was exec'd as "the real tool" and refuses to go round again.

    Order — the first three cost one `stat` at most:

    1. `$FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH` / the per-tool variable: `never` -> wayland,
       `always` -> x11. Skipped when `respect_override=False`, which is for
       callers that never hand over: those variables say what to do about the
       *handover*, and answering "wayland" to `warandr` — which only picks
       between the `xrandr` and `wxrandr` command words — would have
       `FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH=never` select `wxrandr` on an X11 box, i.e.
       exactly the breakage this file exists to fix (`passthrough_mode()` is
       the way to ask about the variables themselves).
    2. `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY` *and* its socket exists -> wayland. The in-session
       case; `$DISPLAY` is deliberately not consulted (Xwayland sets it).
    3. `$XDG_SESSION_TYPE` (pam_systemd sets it at every login) -> that, unless
       `SUDO_UID`/`PKEXEC_UID` says the environment came from another login
       (`sudo` keeps root's `XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty` from an `ssh root@`).
    4. logind's own record of the session (`/run/systemd/sessions/*`,
       key=value, read-only best-effort): the active, local, non-greeter
       session of the target user, and its `TYPE=`.
    5. socket scan: a `wayland-*` socket **owned by the target user** (a GDM
       greeter's `wayland-0` under another uid must not turn an Xfce box into
       a Wayland session), else an X socket -> x11.
    6. Nothing -> None.
