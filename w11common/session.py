"""Discovery of the graphical session's sockets, tolerant of running under sudo
(where XDG_RUNTIME_DIR etc. point at root's empty runtime dir or are unset).
Every tool here starts by asking this module which session it is aimed at, so a
change reaches all six: docs/Technical.md section 2 is the contract.

Four cases that were each broken on a stock GNOME box, and are each a rule now:

* `ssh root@box` (no sudo): pam_systemd gives root its own
  XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/0 with a `bus` in it, so the old "trust
  $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR first" order found root's empty bus and no compositor.
  Candidate runtime dirs are now anchored on the graphical session: a dir
  that holds a `wayland-*` socket sorts before one that does not, then the
  sudo/pkexec invoking user, then real users, then the rest. $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
  still wins when it has a Wayland socket (the normal in-session case, and
  the test rigs' private runtime dirs).
* Likewise `find_user_bus()`: root's own `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`
  (pam_systemd exports `/run/user/0/bus` to an `ssh root@` login) only wins
  when that bus lives next to a Wayland socket; otherwise the scanned bus of
  the graphical session is used.
* `PKEXEC_UID` is honoured next to `SUDO_UID`.
* The X plane of a GNOME session (Xwayland) is found with `find_x_display()`
  (DISPLAY: $DISPLAY, gnome-shell's own environment via /proc, or the
  session user's /tmp/.X11-unix/X* socket) and `find_xauthority()`
  ($XAUTHORITY, Mutter's $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.* cookie,
  GDM's xauth_*, ~/.Xauthority). The GNOME backend asks the bridge first
  (XInfo = gnome-shell's DISPLAY/XAUTHORITY) and uses these as fallbacks.
  `xwayland_running()` tells whether Xwayland is actually up without
  connecting to its socket (Mutter spawns it on demand).
* `find_x_display()` prefers a socket owned by the session user over a
  root-owned one instead of taking the lowest number of either: SDDM leaves
  its greeter's root-owned Xorg on `:0` while the KDE session's Xwayland is
  `:1`, so under `sudo`/`ssh root@` the old order answered with a display the
  session's cookie cannot open and every X-side answer (real `WM_CLASS`,
  client geometry, `wxprop -id`) silently degraded to the synthesized one."""
