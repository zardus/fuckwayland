"""`--unsafe-gnome-overlap-unmeasured`, and the table it exists to be the escape
hatch from.

Two features, one file, because neither makes sense without the other: the table
is what a GNOME release is added to, and the flag is what somebody does on the
GNOME nobody has added yet.

What is held down here:

* **the flag cannot be reached by accident.**  It is not a default in `Opts`, in
  `Session` or in any method signature; no environment variable sets it; it is a
  usage error without `--unsafe-gnome-overlap`, so it can never be the thing that
  turns the feature on; and its required argument is the GNOME Shell major of
  the machine in front of you, so a command line pasted out of a forum is refused
  by number on anybody else's;
* **it is never remembered.**  A forced run neither reads nor writes the
  agreement, `--gnome-overlap-allow` refuses to be typed with it, and
  `save_consent()` refuses a forced reply even if something ever called it;
* **it forces exactly one refusal.**  Every refusal in this feature is either
  *cautious* -- "this is a build nobody here has measured" -- or *certain* --
  a symbol that is not there, an extension that is not there, a compositor that
  is not GNOME, a struct nothing describes, a read that disagrees with Mutter.
  Only the first kind is forceable, and each of the others is re-run here with
  the flag typed and still refuses;
* **the table is one table.**  The extension's `generations.json` and wxrandr's
  `GENERATIONS` are proved identical, `metadata.json` is proved derived from
  them, and nothing anywhere composes a library name out of a number -- which is
  the thing that stopped being true when mutter 51 renumbered libmutter's API
  version to the GNOME major.  The stand-in for an unmeasured GNOME is one
  past the newest record rather than a number written down, because writing
  one down is how these tests came to be testing a build that had since been
  measured;
* **what a refusal prints** is a golden, because a message a maintainer cannot
  act on is the same as no message.
