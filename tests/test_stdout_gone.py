"""Bug 3: what the six tools do when their standard output is not there.

Every one of them printed something no original ever prints:

- `wdotool help >/dev/full` and `warandr --version >/dev/full` exited **120**
  with an "Exception ignored in: <_io.TextIOWrapper name='<stdout>'>" block,
  from the interpreter's own flush of the standard files, after main() had
  already returned 0 -- output lost, status success;
- `wwmctl --help >/dev/full` tracebacked (its guard covered BrokenPipeError
  and KeyboardInterrupt, not the ENOSPC of a write that cannot land);
- `wxprop -grammar >/dev/full` swallowed the error whole and exited 0;
- `wxrandr --help`, `wmirror --help` and `warandr --version` never reached
  their own guard at all, because argparse (and wxrandr's own `-help`) leave
  main() through SystemExit;
- `wdotool help >&-` (fd 1 closed before the interpreter starts, so
  `sys.stdout` is None) tracebacked with an AttributeError;
- Ctrl-C during `wdotool sleep 5` printed a KeyboardInterrupt traceback;
- `tool >/dev/full 2>&1` (0.3, live on 26.04): the diagnostic the guard
  itself prints could not land either, so the OSError left main() as a
  traceback and the interpreter's exit-time flush of that failed stderr
  buffer turned five of the six into exit 120 -- apport filed crash reports
  for two of them on a default desktop.  `stdio.warn()` writes the last
  word every tool says, and closes stderr when it cannot.

What they do now is in w11common/stdio.py: repair a missing stdout at the top
of main(), and flush -- and, on failure, CLOSE -- at the bottom of it, one
line to stderr, silence for a reader that left, and never a traceback.
