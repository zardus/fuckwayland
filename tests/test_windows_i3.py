"""The sway backend's i3 dialect, against the recordings of a live i3 4.25.1.

i3 speaks the same i3-ipc protocol sway does, so `FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH=never` (and `wxrandr --backend
sway`) land on `wdotool/backend_sway.py` on an i3 box -- the default path there is the X11 handover and is
right [M recon2/i3.md §2a].  Forced onto our own code it half-worked and half-lied, and this file is the four
lies, one class each [M recon2/i3.md §2b, §2c]:

* ids: a con id is a pointer (47 bits, `97479943571072`), every X-shaped consumer takes the low 32
  (`0x5168c680`), and `wxprop -id` answered `BadWindow` on it;
* floating: i3 wraps a floating view in a `floating_con`, the walk reset the flag on the way down, and
  `windowmove` refused every window with "cannot move a tiled window";
* pid: i3's tree carries none at all, so `getwindowpid` failed on every window;
* visible: i3's tree carries none either, so `search --onlyvisible` matched nothing.

Doubles only: `support.FakeSway(dialect="i3")` replays `tests/fixtures/i3/*.json` (the tree, the outputs with
their `xroot-0` pseudo-output, the workspaces, GET_VERSION major 4) and `test_wxprop_x11.FakeXServerExt` is the X
plane beside it -- i3 is X11, which is the whole reason the ids and the pids can be had at all."""
