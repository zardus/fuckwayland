"""The no-authorization-dialog guarantee, enforced statically.

GNOME and KDE both show a consent dialog to an application that injects
input through the desktop portal -- xdg-desktop-portal's RemoteDesktop and
InputCapture interfaces, the ones libei speaks -- and a polkit agent window
to anything that asks PolicyKit for an authorization. These tools promise
that neither ever appears: input goes through the kernel's `/dev/uinput` (as
root, or through the udev rule this repo ships), windows and displays go
through the compositor's own session-bus interfaces, and on wlroots input
goes through `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1` / `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1`. Not one
of those has a consent step. README.md's "No authorization dialog" section
states that and records the measurement behind it.

A measurement is a snapshot; this test is the ratchet. The day a package
grows a portal proxy, a libei backend or a PolicyKit action, that README
section stops being true and no dbus-monitor is watching -- so the suite
fails here instead, before it ships. A route that genuinely needs one of
these has to change the README section, the support matrix and this list in
the same commit, which is the point: the guarantee cannot be lost by
accident.

Two things the token list deliberately does *not* match, because our own
code says them to claim the opposite and that claim should stay greppable:
the bare word "portal" (`wmirror` names the portal in the message that
explains why it refuses to mirror on GNOME and KDE) and the bare word
"polkit" (`wdotool/backend_kwin.py` and `wxrandr/` note that KWin scripting
and `kde_output_management_v2` have no polkit action behind them).

**One portal interface is exempt, by name, and only one.**
`org.freedesktop.portal.Settings` reads the desktop's own GSettings and has
no consent step at all: it is what every GTK and Qt application calls at
start-up for the colour scheme, it is answered without a permission check,
and there is no allow/deny record for it in the portal's permission store.
`wdotool/xkbmap.py` calls its `ReadAll` on GNOME to learn which keyboard
layout is active, because Mutter will not tell an unfocused client and dconf
publishes no read method on the bus (`ca.desrt.dconf` has `Init`, `Change`
and `Notify` and nothing else). Measured on GNOME 46.0 and 50.1, with the
whole session bus and both screens watched by the method in README.md's
"No authorization dialog": the call answers in 1-3 ms and nothing appears on
screen. So `.Settings` -- and `org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop`, the bus name
it is reached at -- pass this scan, and every other interface on that same
bus name is still a failure here, RemoteDesktop and InputCapture first among
them. The exemption is one lookahead below, and widening it means changing
README.md's guarantee in the same commit, which is the point.

Not scanned: `tests/` -- this file names every token -- and `vm/`, whose rig
drives a real portal client and `pkexec` on purpose, as the positive
controls that prove a dialog would have been seen if there had been one.
