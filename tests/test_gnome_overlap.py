"""`--unsafe-gnome-overlap`: every refusal, the version gate, the exact warning,
and the proof that no other code path can reach the applying one.

The dangerous half of this feature is eight bytes written inside gnome-shell,
and it needs a GNOME session to run at all; everything *around* it does not, and
that is what is here.  The mock org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig from
tests/test_wxrandr_mutter.py is extended with a mock org.gnome.Shell (for the
ShellVersion property the version gate reads) and a mock
org.w11.Overlap, so a whole `wxrandr --unsafe-gnome-overlap ...`
invocation runs end to end on a bus in this process, and every refusal can be
demanded rather than argued.

The rules the extension applies are in gnome/w11-overlap@w11/
rules.js, deliberately in a file with no `gi` imports so that plain node can run
it: `RulesJS` checks it against wxrandr/monitors_xml.py, which is the same rule
written twice, and skips itself where there is no node.

Four things this file is here to hold still:

* the extension is never contacted for a layout GNOME would accept, whatever
  flags were typed;
* nothing but the flag reaches it -- no environment variable, no default, no
  other backend, and not `--persistent`;
* the warning is printed in full, before the call, every time -- these tests
  record no agreement, and tests/test_overlap_consent.py is what happens when
  one is recorded; and
* the shipped type description cannot name Mutter's monitors.xml writer, and
  the apply method is a constant.

WARNING = """\
xrandr: --unsafe-gnome-overlap: GNOME will not place these monitors, so they are going to be
  placed by writing into the running gnome-shell instead of asking it.
  What it does:         move Virtual-2 from +1920+0 to +960+0
                        by writing 8 bytes per monitor inside gnome-shell
                        (GNOME Shell 50.1), through the w11-overlap@w11
                        extension, and then asking Mutter to apply the result.
  What it risks:        those 8 bytes go where this build of libmutter keeps a
                        logical monitor's position.  The extension re-checks
                        that this really is such a build before every write --
                        struct size against the GType registry, a sentinel
                        through Mutter's own setter, and every value it reads
                        against what Mutter reports publicly -- and refuses if
                        anything disagrees.  If all of that is wrong anyway,
                        gnome-shell crashes, and on Wayland gnome-shell is the
                        session: every program running in it goes with it.
  What it saves:        nothing.  ~/.config/monitors.xml is never written on
                        this path, so this layout does not survive a logout,
                        and --persistent is refused together with this flag.
  To undo:              wxrandr --output Virtual-1 --pos 0x0 --output Virtual-2 --pos 1920x0
                        or log out and back in.
  If the session dies:  gnome-shell is the session on Wayland, so you land at
                        the login screen.  Log in again -- nothing was saved,
                        so the layout is the one you started with.
                        If a session will not start at all, switch to a text
                        console with Ctrl+Alt+F3, log in and run
                            gnome-extensions disable w11-overlap@w11
