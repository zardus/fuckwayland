"""wxprop on Plasma: the KWin backend driven through the CLI.

The counterpart of tests/test_wxprop_gnome.py for the other Wayland desktop.
What is here rather than there: KWin has no window signals on D-Bus at all,
so `-spy` runs on a script that stays loaded in the compositor and calls back
out for every Qt signal it hooked -- a different stream, with the same
contract (reprint when a watched property changed, exit when the window
goes). And Plasma 6 mints its window ids from KWin uuids while XWayland keeps
real X ids, so the two id spaces sit side by side in one listing and `-id`
has to say which one it was handed.

Measured on the rig (resolute-kde, Plasma 6.6 / KWin 6.6.6): `wxprop -id`
prints WM_CLASS and _NET_WM_STATE correctly for both planes, which is what
the dumps below are checked against."""
