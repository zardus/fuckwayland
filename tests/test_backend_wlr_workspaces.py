"""U11: the wlr floor's desktops, over `ext_workspace_manager_v1`.

`wwmctl -d` answered `get_desktop is not supported by the wlr backend` on labwc while labwc's own panel was
showing three workspaces, and on Budgie and Xfce-on-Wayland while theirs showed four. All three publish
`ext_workspace_manager_v1` v1 and were read by hand with a 25-line `wayland_mini` client [M recon2/labwc.md
§6a: one group, `one` with state 1, `two`, `three`, each caps=1; budgie.md: `Workspace 1..4`;
xfce-wayland.md: four the same way]. sway 1.11 and Wayfire 0.10 publish no workspace protocol at all, so the
refusal has to survive exactly where it is right today [M labwc.md §2, wayfire.md §1.1].

The peer is a real compositor on a real socket: `wl_fake.WorkspaceServer` replays the recorded event order
(group, then each workspace's name, coordinates where they exist, state and capabilities, then the manager's
`done`) and records every request, so "set_desktop 2 sent activate on the third handle and then commit" is a
statement about bytes and not about a mock's call log. `set_active()` is what lets a test tell an accepted
activate from an ignored one: the compositor moves the bit and re-sends the states, the way a real one does,
and the backend has to read it back rather than remember what it asked for.
