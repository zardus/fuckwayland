"""wxrandr against a REAL KWin: Plasma 6.6 (KWin 6.6.6) on the QEMU rig.

Everything here was measured by hand on `resolute-kde` on 2026-09-08 (package
route, nothing else installed) and is asserted against the compositor's own
tool, `kscreen-doctor -o`, never against another wxrandr answer: the discovery
path (`kde_output_device_v2` + `kde_output_device_registry_v2`), one apply that
has to land edge to edge, the mirror that shows up as a `replicationSource` in
`~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json`, and F4.1's live twin -- two Xwayland windows
with the SAME title, where `wwmctl -i -r <xid> -e` has to move the one whose X
id it was given and not the first match by name.

Opt-in twice over, because it drives a virtual machine:

    VMCTL_LIVE=1 WXRANDR_LIVE_KWIN=1 python3 tests/test_wxrandr_kwin_live.py

and the instance has to be up already (`vm/vmctl start kde66`, or
`--flavor resolute-kde --heads 2 --fresh` for a new one; name it in
WXRANDR_LIVE_KWIN_VM, default `kde66`).  Nothing here starts or stops a VM:
this host caps the guest at 20 GiB and runs one VM at a time, so who is
running is the caller's decision, not a test's.  The whole-desktop version of
these steps is `vm/live-smoke.sh resolute-kde` (the `kwin` phase).

Plasma 6.7 (`stonking-kde`) is the follow-on T67 names: KWin 6.7 stopped
advertising `kde_output_device_v2` as a plain global and hands the devices out
through `kde_output_device_registry_v2` instead (registry version 23, `removed`
opcode 36), which is the one release where there is no other way to see the
outputs at all.  That golden is not built on this host, so that case skips on a
CONDITION -- the golden file plus an instance of it -- and turns itself on the
day `vm/vmctl build stonking-kde` runs, rather than being an unconditional skip
with an empty body that could never fail or ever come back."""
