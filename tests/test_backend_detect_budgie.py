"""Detection on a desktop that owns org.gnome.Shell without being GNOME.

CI run 34308982263 (commit 4d6fd40) failed every window check on resolute-budgie with one line:

    gnome backend: the w11 bridge extension is installed in
    /usr/share/gnome-shell/extensions/w11-bridge@w11 but the running GNOME Shell has not
    loaded it (it knows nothing about w11-bridge@w11): log out and back in

There is no GNOME Shell on that flavor.  Ubuntu Budgie 10.10.2 is labwc under a panel, and
`busctl --user list --no-pager --acquired` in the guest on 2026-09-09 (recorded whole in
tests/fixtures/live/busnames-resolute-budgie-10.10.2.txt) shows `org.gnome.Shell` owned by
budgie-power-dialog, pid 2697, connection :1.85 -- and no `org.gnome.Mutter.*` name anywhere on that bus.
`detect()` read the one name as "this is GNOME" and stopped, on a session whose compositor advertises
zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1 and whose windows the wlr backend lists fine (61 pass / 0 fail on the rig
after the fix, against 35 pass / 10 fail in that CI run).

Two questions per test here, both about ONE ListNames answer and one registry: which arm a name list lands
on, and how many round trips it took to get there.  The bus is `MockBus` and the compositor is a
`wl_fake.registry_server` replaying a recorded global list, so nothing below is a stub agreeing with itself.
