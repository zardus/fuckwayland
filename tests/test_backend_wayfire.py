"""wdotool's Wayfire backend, over Wayfire's own JSON IPC.

Everything here is a wire fact, so the peer is a real unix socket speaking the real bytes: `FakeWayfire`
replays the captures recorded off a live Wayfire 0.10.0 [M recon2/wayfire.md §1.2] and records every method
with the data it was handed. That last part is the point of most of this file -- Wayfire's argument names are
not consistent (`view_id` with an underscore in wm-actions, `view-id` and `output-id` with a hyphen in
vswitch), and a misspelled one is not an error the compositor refuses in a way a user would understand: it is
`Missing "output-id"` out of a plugin nobody asked for.

The two things this backend exists to fix, both measured against the wlr floor that Wayfire lands on without
it [M recon2/wayfire.md §2.3, §2.4]: the floor reported the *output* rectangle as every window's
geometry and had no pid, no desktops and no move; and it printed `XTerm.XTerm` where wmctrl on the same
session printed `xterm.XTerm`, because the wlr `app_id` is the WM_CLASS class and the instance is only on the
X plane. U23 below is the second one, end to end, against a real X server."""
