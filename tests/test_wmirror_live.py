"""wmirror against a real headless sway: detection, a start, and the two
output changes that must end a running mirror.

Everything else about wmirror is proved against doubles -- a fake registry,
`FakeWatch` replaying zwlr_output_manager events, a stub wl-mirror. This file
is the one place where the supervisor's watch reads REAL
zwlr_output_management events off a real compositor, which is the half the
doubles cannot vouch for: the fake decides both what an event looks like and
when it arrives, so a supervisor that never subscribed, or that read a serial
it never got, would pass every one of those tests.

sway is the whole audience for this tool (wlroots only, by design), and
`swaymsg create_output` gives a headless one a second head with no hardware
at all -- so the two-output layout the mirror needs is real, and
`swaymsg output HEADLESS-2 disable` is the same request a user makes.

The helper is still the stub from tests/support.py: wl-mirror is not a
dependency of this suite, and what is under test here is what the supervisor
does about the layout, not what wl-mirror paints. Measured on sway 1.11 on
this host -- `wmirror --check` reads
`zwlr_screencopy_manager_v1 v3, ext_image_copy_capture_manager_v1 v1` off
that registry.
