"""The layout box under fractional and HiDPI scaling, against what the
desktops really do.

Every absolute pointer command is mapped across the layout bounding box
`_wayland_bbox()` reads off the wire, so which pixel space that box is in
decides where `mousemove` lands.  Each case below is one state measured on a
real desktop -- the wire values on the left, the pointer space the hardware
cursor was actually found in on the right -- so the fake compositor here is
a replay of a measurement, not an invention.  What was measured, and how:
`repro/README.md`, "the scaling pass"; the raw readings are in
`tests/fixtures/scaling/`.

The oracle in the guest was the KMS cursor plane (`/sys/kernel/debug/dri/
*/state`, device pixels on the scanout, which nothing in w11
produces) and, where the compositor draws its own cursor instead of using
that plane, a QMP screendump differenced against a parked one.

One measured state is a compositor bug rather than a pixel space:
StaleXdgOutput, where GNOME 46 keeps advertising a layout it has stopped
drawing -- and keeps mapping absolute pointer motion across it, which is why
the wire's box is still the right one for the pointer there.  What is wrong
in that state is what the user is *told*, and DisplayConfigSource below is
the second source that notices.

    without re-sending `zxdg_output_v1.logical_size`.  Measured on
    `noble-gnome-iso`, four times out of four, persisting past a 90s wait
    and past re-applying the same scale:

      org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig   960x540   (the desktop being drawn)
      zxdg_output_v1.logical_size    1920x1080   (stale)
      wl_output mode/scale           1920x1080 @2

    So we advertise a 1920x1080 layout for a 960x540 desktop: every target
    lands at twice its intended fraction of the screen, and everything past
    the middle lands off it -- `mousemove 1600 1000` moved the cursor
    nowhere visible while `getmouselocation` reported 1600,1000.

    AND THE STALE NUMBER IS THE ONE THE POINTER NEEDS.  Mutter maps an
    absolute device across the same rectangle it is still advertising, so with
    this box every target lands exactly where it was asked for -- measured in
    that state against the KMS cursor plane, all eight targets, 1:1 in the
    desktop's own logical coordinates:

      box 1920x1080 (the wire)       asked 100,100 -> logical 100,100

                                     asked 479,269 -> the bottom-right corner

    So believing DisplayConfig here -- the obvious fix, and the one this file
    first asserted -- doubles every coordinate.  What IS wrong in that state
    is what the user is told: `getdisplaygeometry` reports 1920x1080 for a
    desktop that ends at 959,539, so a coordinate worked out from it misses.
    That is a diagnostic (DisplayConfigSource), not a different box.

    """The twelve other capture files under tests/fixtures/scaling, which
    nothing read until now.

    Each is one run of `repro/scale-probe.py` inside a guest at one scaling
    state: the monitor layout `wxrandr --query` reported, the box the daemon
    computed there, and per target the coordinate `mousemove` was asked for,
    the coordinate the daemon then reported, and -- where the compositor uses
    the KMS cursor plane rather than drawing its own cursor -- where that
    plane really was, in device pixels on the scanout, read out of
    /sys/kernel/debug/dri/*/state.

    Three claims, over every file:

    * replaying the recorded monitor layout as wl_output + zxdg_output_v1
      gives back the box the daemon reported in the guest, so what the wire
      code here computes is what the guest computed;
    * every landing is the coordinate that was asked for, clamped into that
      box -- the whole point of the pointer mapping, at 1, 1.5 and 2 and on
      mixed-scale pairs;
    * the cursor plane is at that coordinate times the head's own device
      factor, less one constant cursor hotspot per head.

    Two of the four tests below execute no wdotool code: they are
    consistency checks over recorded output -- the daemon's own answers from
    inside the guest against the KMS planes read out beside them -- and they
    are here as oracles for the captures, not as coverage of the pointer
    mapping. What they catch is a capture edited or replaced with one that
    does not hold together. Only
    test_the_wire_replays_to_the_box_the_daemon_reported runs product code
    (the wl_output/zxdg_output_v1 wire through layoutbox), and
    test_every_capture_in_the_directory_is_read_by_a_test is a ratchet on the
    directory.

    The hotspots are the measurement, not a rule: GNOME 50 draws the cursor
    with a 4/6/8 device-pixel hotspot at scale 1/1.5/2 (it scales the cursor
    image with the head), GNOME 46 with 6 at scale 2 in both layout modes and
    3-4 on an unscaled second head, and KWin 6.6 with 5 at scale 1 and 7-8 at
    1.5 -- and at scale 2 KWin drew its own cursor instead, so
    resolute-kde-1h-kde-scale2.json has no plane reading at all. The one
    device pixel of slack is the fractional cases' rounding: at 1.5 a logical
    coordinate does not land on a device pixel and the compositor and this
    arithmetic may round it opposite ways.
