"""wmirror: the lifetime of the helper, driven against a stub wl-mirror.

wl-mirror is a process that has to outlive the command that started it, so
wmirror follows wxrandr/gamma.py's holder: double-fork, (pid, starttime) in
a state file, uid check before any signal, bounded SIGTERM then SIGKILL.
What is new here is that the process is not ours -- so the record carries
two (pid, starttime) pairs, and every transition below has to leave nothing
running that `wmirror --list` cannot find and `wmirror --stop` cannot end.

The stub stands in for wl-mirror: it prints the libEGL chatter the real one
prints while it is working perfectly (a launcher must never read stderr as
failure), and it can be told to fail at startup or to die later.
