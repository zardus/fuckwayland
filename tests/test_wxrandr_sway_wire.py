"""wxrandr's own sway IPC client against a compositor that is wedged, dying or
lying.

wdotool's sway backend was hardened first (tests/test_wire_hardening.py:
SwayWireGuards) and wxrandr's was not, although it speaks the same i3-ipc
protocol on the same socket and is the one that applies layouts.  The two are
separate code -- `wdotool/backend_sway.py` against `wxrandr/core.py`'s
`SwayIPC` -- so nothing proved about one holds for the other, and this is the
other.

The double is `support.FakeSway`, the same one wdotool's guards use, in the six
shapes a real sway can present: answering, going away mid-chain, framing a reply
whose body is not JSON, accepting the connection and never answering again,
refusing an output command in words, and describing an output without the field
that says where it is.  Everything here goes through `cli.main` with `--backend
sway`, because that is what a user runs and because the answer that matters is
what reaches stderr and what the exit status is -- one line, never a traceback,
and never an unbounded wait.

sway lives on this host (live-measurements.md: test_windows_sway,
test_input_geometry_sway and test_wxrandr_live all pass against a real headless
sway 1.11 here), and tests/test_wxrandr_live.py is where the healthy path is
measured.  Nothing here needs a compositor.
