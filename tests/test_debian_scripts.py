"""dpkg's two maintainer scripts, run as processes, and the .deb into a scratch root.

`debian/fuckwayland.postinst` and `debian/fuckwayland.postrm` are the only code
in this project that runs as root on a stranger's machine, and they had no test
of any kind: what they do was read out of them, never executed.  Both are POSIX
sh under `set -e` and both take `DPKG_ROOT`, which is what makes them runnable
here -- every path they write is under it, and the udev half is skipped by
their own first condition when it is set (a chroot has no /run/udev).

One thing this found, and one half of the finding it leaves standing.  The
banner is printed by `cat <<'EOM'` with the stamp already written, so
`apt install ./fuckwayland.deb | tail -1` -- a pipe whose
reader leaves -- killed `cat` with SIGPIPE, `set -e` propagated 141, and dpkg
reported the package's configuration as failed over a banner nobody was
reading.  A retry then printed nothing, because the stamp was there, and the
failure looked arbitrary.  That is fix 55 (finding F6.4), applied here as
`cat <<'EOM' || true`.  The other half of F6.4 -- that the stamp is written
before the banner rather than after -- stands as it is: the stamp is the record
that this installation happened, and a banner that fails is not a reason to
say it did not.

The scratch-root install is the whole package through real dpkg: six scripts in
usr/bin, the autostart symlink, the stamp, the banner exactly once, and nothing
left under usr/ after `-r` but the empty directories dpkg does not remove.
