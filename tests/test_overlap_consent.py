"""The agreement to `--unsafe-gnome-overlap`: where it lives, what it records,
what it silences, and -- at length -- everything it cannot do.

The feature is a paragraph that stops being printed.  That is all it is, and
most of this file exists to hold that down, because the tempting version of this
feature (a remembered yes that lets the tool skip ahead) is the one that would
eventually cost somebody their session.  So:

* an agreement is recorded only against a build the six checks have just passed
  on, and it records what they measured -- the Shell version, libmutter's
  generation and the size this build's `MetaMonitorsConfig` turned out to be;
* it stops applying the moment any of that changes, which is what a distribution
  upgrade does;
* it is never consulted for whether to check anything.  Every refusal in
  tests/test_gnome_overlap.py is re-run here *with* an agreement recorded, and
  every one of them still refuses;
* and it is not the flag: an overlapping layout with no `--unsafe-gnome-overlap`
  is still GNOME's refusal, agreement or no agreement.

The harness is tests/test_gnome_overlap.py's -- a mock DisplayConfig, a mock
org.gnome.Shell and a mock extension on a bus in this process, with
XDG_CONFIG_HOME pointed at a temporary directory, which is where the agreement
then lands.
