"""scripts/ci-golden.sh: where a base image comes from, and what a cached
golden is keyed by.

R08 and R09.  Two claims, both of which were false in the tree the day this
file was written and both of which cost a whole CI job to discover:

* **The download rules.**  CI run 34340513060 was green on 25 rig jobs and red
  on five -- fedora44-gnome, fedora44-sway, arch-sway, arch-hypr, nixos-sway --
  and every one of them failed the same way: `ci-golden: no download rule for
  Fedora-Cloud-Base-Generic-44-1.7.x86_64.qcow2`, forty seconds into a job that
  had already installed QEMU.  A rule is one `case` arm, and the thing that
  makes it worth a test is that it is unreachable from any unit run: the arm is
  chosen by a file name written in a flavor's yaml, and nothing but a rig job
  ever puts the two together.  `TheFlavorsAllHaveARule` is that join, done
  here in a tenth of a second.
* **The cache key.**  A golden is pulled by `<flavor>:<key>` and the key is a
  sha256 over the files that decide the image's contents.  Two failure modes,
  opposite and both silent: a file missing from the list means a recipe change
  that never rebuilds (CI keeps pulling last week's image and reports it green),
  and a file added to the list -- or the same files hashed in another order --
  invalidates every golden in GHCR at once and costs an hour of builds.  So the
  six-file list is asserted verbatim, in order, and the NixOS list beside it.

The measured URLs behind the two new rules: Fedora 44's cloud image answered at
dl.fedoraproject.org on 2026-09-08, 583 729 152 bytes, sha256 28680fe5...b7f
matching the published CHECKSUM [recon2/fedora.md 2], and the Arch cloud image
at geo.mirror.pkgbuild.com, 559 223 808 bytes, sha256 e3e688f9...930 matching
its published `.SHA256` [recon2/arch.md 1].
