"""scripts/check-docs.py, run by the suite, and its two blind spots mutated.

The script is the project's guard against a document that disagrees with a
fact, and it was itself unguarded: nobody ran it except by hand, and a check
that stops catching things is indistinguishable from a tree with nothing wrong
in it.  So this file runs it -- `main([]) == 0` over the real tree, which is
the same six seconds a maintainer spends -- and then breaks the tree on purpose
in the two ways it used to miss.

Both were measured by patching the script's own module-level functions and
watching a planted contradiction go unreported:

* `where = [n for n, t in docs.items() if opt in t]` was a substring test, so
  `--backen` counted as documented because `--backend` is written down, and
  `--persisten` because `--persistent` is.  Every option of `wxrandr` whose
  name is a prefix of another was un-checkable.  Fix 52, first half: a
  word-boundary match, with `-` treated as a word character.
* `accepted = code | options_in_help(tool) | SILENT` for the four hand-written
  parsers folded the help text into the set of options the tool accepts, so
  `helped - accepted` was empty by construction and the last loop -- the one
  that reports an option a help text prints and no parser takes -- could never
  fire.  A typo in a usage string was invisible.  Fix 52, second half.

The second half needed one more thing to be true: `options_in_code` could not
see the four getopt-shaped parsers at all, because their long options are bare
names in `(name, takes_arg)` tables and never appear as `"--..."` literals.
Reading those tables put 32 real `wdotool` options back into `accepted`
(`--sync`, `--terminator`, `--repeat-delay`, ...) and `wdotool --version`,
which xdotool accepts and leaves out of its help, into SILENT with the reason.
