"""Cross-document links, and the rig's flavor images as three descriptions of
one directory.

Two kinds of claim, both of them the sort that decays without anybody noticing.

**Links.** Twenty-one markdown files link to each other and into their own
headings, 164 links in all, and a heading that is reworded takes every anchor
pointing at it with it -- silently, because a bad anchor renders as a link that
scrolls nowhere.  GitHub's slug rules are simple enough to reimplement exactly
(lowercase, backticks dropped, everything that is not a word character,
whitespace or `-` removed, whitespace to `-`, duplicates suffixed `-1`), so
every anchor is resolved against the headings of the file it points into.

**The rig's flavor images.** `vm/flavors/*.yaml` is the fact; `vm/README.md`'s
table and README.md's support matrix are two descriptions of it, and the counts
in the prose are a third.  Every number here is read back out of the directory
and the yaml headers, never asserted as a literal: the flavor list went from 13
to 38 over one wave of work, and a test carrying "thirteen" in its own source
would have had to be rewritten rather than re-run.  Each flavor's yaml carries
`# vmctl-desktop:`, which `vm/vmctl` looks up in its own `DESKTOPS` table, so a
flavor naming a desktop vmctl does not have is an image that cannot be built --
and would be discovered by building it, forty minutes later.  It also carries
`# vmctl-distro:` and `# vmctl-ci:`, which the table's own two rightmost columns
repeat for a reader; those are checked cell by cell (R28).
