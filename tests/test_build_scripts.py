"""scripts/build-pyz.sh, build-deb.sh, build-rpm.sh and build-pkgbuild.sh.

Every one of them is run against a temporary copy of the tree, never against
the tree itself: `build-pyz.sh` writes into `dist/`, which parallel test runs
would race on, and `build-deb.sh` edits `debian/` and moves files into
`release/`, which is committed.  The copy is what makes it safe to run them at
all, and running them is the only way to know that six zipapps still contain
what their comments say they do.

The zipapps are the second install route (`git clone` plus one command, no
dpkg), and the claim about them is a claim about bundle contents: `wxrandr`,
`warandr` and `wmirror` deliberately carry no `wdotool/` -- that is 680 kB per
file, and it means those three do not drag in the keysym table, the input daemon
and four window backends for three small modules.  Nothing checked it, so the
saving was one careless `build` line from being silently undone.

`build-deb.sh` is checked for its refusals rather than for a build: a real one
needs dpkg-buildpackage, debhelper and eight minutes.  The refusal that matters
is the version gate -- pyproject.toml and debian/changelog disagreeing is
exactly how a package named for the previous release gets committed, which is
what happened between 0.3 and 0.4.

`build-rpm.sh` and `build-pkgbuild.sh` are its siblings and carry the same
option shape, so the same four cases transpose -- with two more places for the
version to be wrong (the spec's Version: AND its top %changelog) and one more
thing to prove: the recipe build-pkgbuild.sh generates has to carry the real
sha256 of the tarball it just made.  `SKIP` there would mean CI builds whatever
the tarball happened to be.  Neither is run for real: rpmbuild here dies on
Fedora's %pyproject_* macros and makepkg needs a /proc this sandbox has not got
[recon2/pkg-rpm.md 4, pkg-arch.md 2], so both get stubbed tools and a PATH that
holds nothing else -- which is also what makes "this tool is missing" a fact of
the test rather than of the machine running it.
