"""AGENTS.md's one rule, as a gate the suite runs.

The rule is in the tree as prose (AGENTS.md, landed 2d06ae3) and it names four
sentences that must never appear: "Wayland forbids it, so we don't", "Not
possible on Wayland", "By design", "The compositor is right to refuse this".
Prose is not a gate -- batch 16 found two copies of "impossible on Wayland" in
its own step files by grepping for them by hand, batch 14 found a third in
river.sh, and batch 20's sweep of 2026-09-09 found the fourth in a place no
grep of the rig would ever reach: `wdotool windowreparent` printed
"reparenting is not possible on Wayland; ignoring" to a user's stderr.  A
sentence that only a hand-grep catches comes back.

So the three unambiguous phrasings are banned tree-wide here, and the fourth
("by design", which has honest uses about our OWN design and about a library's
API shape) is allow-listed line by line: a new one has to be written into
ALLOWED_BY_DESIGN with its reason, which is the review this rule wants.

The second half is the positive form of the rule.  A refusal is allowed to
name what a protocol lacks -- that is a fact -- but it owes the user the route
that would close it and what that route costs.  The three refusals reworded on
2026-09-09 are pinned here by the thing that makes them right: each carries a
NOT-YET and a rung of AGENTS.md's ladder.
