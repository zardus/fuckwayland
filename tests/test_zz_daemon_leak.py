"""Suite-wide guard: no test may leave an input daemon running.

This is the leak itself, not a hypothetical one. The suite spawned daemons
and did not stop them, which is how the test rig came to have 161 of them
alive at once -- ~3GB of resident memory, each listening on a socket in a
per-test runtime directory that had since been deleted, so they were
unreachable as well as immortal; the oldest had been running eighteen
hours. Stopping belongs to the tests that spawn (support.stop_daemons_under
registered before the spawn, so it runs however the test ends); this makes
sure the next test to spawn one cannot quietly forget.

`zz`, because both runners that collect a directory sort the files: this
one goes last. The daemons alive at *import* are the baseline, and import
is before any test has run under both of them -- `unittest discover` loads
every module while building the suite, and pytest collects before it runs.
A daemon that was already there is somebody's real one, or another suite
running beside this one, and is not this suite's business.
