"""`.github/workflows/ci.yml` read as text, because the claims are about its
shape and the standard library has no YAML parser.

R25.  The workflow is the one file in the tree that nothing else can check: it
runs on GitHub and its mistakes are discovered by pushing.  Every failure this
file pins has happened to this project at least once --

* a test file added and no job running it (the matrix is a glob over
  `tests/test_*.py`, so the claim is that the glob is still the glob);
* a rig flavor added, `# vmctl-ci: push` in its yaml, and the plan step no
  longer reading that header, so the flavor is never built;
* the rig installing the COMMITTED release/*.deb instead of the one this push
  built -- every rig result before run 34340513060 measured the last release
  and nobody could tell from the log;
* `continue-on-error` spreading: one job whose distro really is rolling is a
  reason, five jobs that are merely flaky is a suite nobody reads.

So the header comment at the top of the file is treated as the index it looks
like: every name it lists is a job, and every job is listed.  Somebody adding a
job and not the sentence is the common case, and the sentence is what a person
reads first.
