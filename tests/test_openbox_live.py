"""U38: Openbox on a real X server -- the desktop Lubuntu ships, measured.

Lubuntu 26.04 is LXQt 2.3 on Openbox under SDDM, and nothing in this tree had ever mentioned any of the
three [M recon2/openbox.md].  What that report found, in a real SDDM+LXQt VM, was that in the session every
tool hands over and works, and out of it -- `ssh root@box` with an empty environment -- all four failed with
`Authorization required, but no authorization protocol specified`, because SDDM writes the cookie to
`/tmp/xauth_<random>` and `_SESSION_LEADERS` named no process of that desktop to read it from.

Three claims here.  Two are against `support.HeadlessOpenbox` (Xvfb + openbox, no LXQt around it):

* the handover parity of the i3 file, on the other X11 window manager;
* `_shell_environ()` recognising a real `openbox` process as a session leader and reading its `$DISPLAY`,
  which is the mechanism the cookie route is built on.  The cookie itself needs a display manager and is the
  rig's business (`vm/flavors/resolute-lxqt.yaml`); what can be proved on this box is the scan.

The third is `SessionCookieUid` at the end, which needs neither: §2d of the same report is about *which uid*
that scan is run for, and it is measured entirely in which argument reaches `session.find_xauthority()`."""
