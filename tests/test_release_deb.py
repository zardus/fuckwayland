"""What actually ships: the package committed in `release/`, and what the documents say about it.

Every other file in this suite runs the *tree*.  What a user runs is
`sudo apt install ./release/fuckwayland_<version>_all.deb`, which is a binary in the
repository -- and nothing in the tree makes that binary agree with the tree.  While 0.4
was being finished it did not agree: the committed file was the build of the v0.3 tag,
put there by "Release version 0.3" and never rebuilt, so a user who followed the README
got none of the release's changes.  Measured on both default GNOME images, from the shipped
package: the input daemon still outlived a removed socket and then held the lock that
stops the next one starting, a chord the layout cannot produce was still pressed at its
US position in silence, the layout notice still reached only the first command, and the
overlap extension was not in the package at all -- while README.md said "the package
carries a second, separate extension".

So: the payload is compared with the tree, file by file.  It is the only test here that
can fail for something nobody typed.
