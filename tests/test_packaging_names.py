"""One logical dependency, four package names, five files that spell them.

`wxprop` hands over to the real xprop on an X11 session, and when it is not
there the tool says so and names the package to install.  That package is
called `x11-utils` on Debian, `xprop` on Fedora, `xorg-xprop` on Arch and
`xorg.xprop` in nixpkgs -- measured, all four -- and the same four names have to
appear in four other places: debian/control's Suggests, the spec's
Recommends/Suggests, the PKGBUILD's optdepends and the NixOS module's
x11Tools/wlMirror options.  Nine places, one fact, and until now nothing
connected them: the tools printed `apt install x11-utils` on Fedora, on Arch
and on NixOS, which has no apt at all [recon2/fedora.md, arch.md, nixos.md].

fwcommon/distro.py is the fifth column -- the table the running tool reads --
and this file is what keeps it and the four packagings saying the same thing.
The last test is the sharp one: a packaging that names ANOTHER distribution's
package (the spec saying x11-utils, the PKGBUILD saying xorg-x11-server-utils)
is a copy-paste that installs nothing and is invisible until somebody tries it.
