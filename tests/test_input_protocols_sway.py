"""zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1 and zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1 against a real wlroots.

tests/test_vkbd.py and tests/test_vptr.py prove the *bytes*: a fake compositor
on a real socket reads back every request and every field. What they cannot
prove is that wlroots accepts them -- a request with a plausible body and the
wrong opcode, an axis event sent without the frame that delivers it, a keymap
fd wlroots refuses to mmap, all look identical to a fake that was written
from the same reading of the XML as the client. sway raises a protocol error
and hangs up instead, so here every group of requests ends in the round trip
(`flush()`) that turns that into an exception.

Measured against sway 1.11 (the resolute-sway golden's compositor), headless,
booted per class on its own XDG_RUNTIME_DIR by `support.HeadlessSway`.

The last class is the session these protocols exist for: no /dev/uinput, no
root, nothing to fall back to. It spawns a real daemon with
WDOTOOL_UINPUT_PATH pointed at a path that cannot be opened and drives it
over its socket, which is what `wdotool --vkbd on` does on a stock sway.
