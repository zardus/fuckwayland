"""`--unsafe-gnome-overlap` against a compositor that is really running.

Two halves, and only the first of them runs on a developer's machine:

* **the negative cell**, on a private headless sway booted here: the flag is a
  refusal off GNOME, before any bus call, and that is worth proving against a
  real compositor rather than a mock because the refusal is what stands between
  somebody's KDE session and a feature that has no business there;
* **the GNOME cells**, which write eight bytes into a running gnome-shell and
  are therefore opt-in twice over: `WXRANDR_LIVE_GNOME=1` in the environment,
  *and* an `org.gnome.Shell` that owns its name on the session bus.  They are
  meant for the rig (`vm/vmctl`, the noble-gnome / resolute-gnome /
  stonking-gnome goldens, run as the session user with `vmctl user`), on a
  snapshot instance where a dead session costs nothing.  With the variable
  unset every one of them skips and says which variable it wanted.

The reason for the double gate is the thing being tested.  A wrong offset here
does not fail a test, it ends the session the test is running in -- so this
file must never be able to run its writes because somebody typed
`python3 tests/test_gnome_overlap_live.py` on their own desktop.

What the GNOME cells hold down is what tests/test_gnome_overlap.py can only
model: that the checks pass on a real libmutter, that the agreement records the
build that is actually mapped, that the layout comes back, that
~/.config/monitors.xml is not touched by any of it, and that the refusal which
was measured killing a session (a forced `--dryrun`) refuses instead.  The
other measured killer -- a description naming a shared library that is not
there -- is not here: it needs a scratch extension directory under
~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions and a relogin for gnome-shell to scan it,
which no unittest can arrange from inside the session it would end, so it lives
in vm/live-smoke.sh (T63) instead of as a cell that can only skip.

Measured on the rig at 0.4, GNOME 46.0 / noble-gnome, package route: the six
checks pass with the shipped FwOverlap14; the first apply with no agreement
recorded APPLIED (Virtual-2 to +1000+0, screenshots show head 1 repeating head
0's pixels from x=1000); `--gnome-overlap-allow` recorded {"agreed", "format":
1, "how", "libmutter": "14", "libmutter_build": ..., "shell": "46.0",
"struct_size": 72}; a second apply at +1200+0 with a loop appending to
~/.config/monitors.xml every 50 ms did not reach the "ok:false after apply"
branch (rc 0, applied, digest unchanged) -- so that cell records whether it can
be reached at all rather than asserting that it is.
