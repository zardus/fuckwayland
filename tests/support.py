"""Doubles the test files share, in one place.

Not named `test_*.py` on purpose: the escape-hatch guard in
`tests/test_passthrough.py` walks the test files and would count this one,
and no runner should try to collect it. It is imported bare (`import
support`) rather than as `tests.support`, because every way the suite is
run -- `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`, `python3 -m pytest
tests/x.py`, `python3 tests/x.py` -- puts the tests directory itself on
sys.path, and eight of the files that need it carry no repo-root bootstrap.

What lives here is only what was written more than once and byte-identical
in behaviour: the recorder uinput device and its tablet reader, the
environment context manager, the faked evdev layer, the headless sway
rig the four XWayland live files boot, and stopping a spawned input
daemon -- which three files do, all three differently and none of them
reliably (see the daemon section below). Doubles that differ between their
callers stay where they are -- `make_daemon` (three shapes of `geom`),
`FakeDaemon` (two protocols), `FakeBackend`, the compositor fakes.

Added for the second round of tests, under the same rule -- each one was
about to be written twice: the markdown walker three files carry
(`documents`), the shell-script slicer (`sh_block`/`sh_function`), the fake
GNOME command line the install scripts need (`fake_gnome_bin`), the node
harness that runs the two GNOME extensions (`js_harness`, with
tests/fixtures/gjs/), the sway IPC double (`FakeSway`), the session leader
stand-in (`leader_process`) and the wl-mirror stub (`WL_MIRROR_STUB`).
tests/test_support_helpers.py is where each of them is proved.

Added for the second design round, same rule and the same file to prove them
in: the Hyprland IPC double and its event socket (`FakeHypr`,
`FakeHyprEvents`), the Wayfire IPC double (`FakeWayfire`), `FakeSway`'s i3
dialect, and the five headless compositors the live tests boot
(`HeadlessLabwc`, `HeadlessWayfire`, `HeadlessRiver`, `HeadlessI3`,
`HeadlessOpenbox`) beside `HeadlessSway`. Every payload one of them replays
is a recording under tests/fixtures/, named where it is used.

    fwcommon.session finds the X display and the X authority cookie by walking
    /proc for the session's leader -- SDDM writes /tmp/xauth_<random>, which is
    in nobody's runtime directory and is not ~/.Xauthority, so on Plasma X11
    the leader's own environ is the only thing that knows where the cookie is.
    Testing that ranking needs processes with those names and those variables,
    and nothing else: comm is 15 characters, and `startplasma-x11` is exactly
    15, so the truncation is part of what this proves rather than something it
    dodges.

    The stand-in is a copy of /bin/sh blocked on `read`, NOT a copy of `sleep`:
    Ubuntu 26.04 ships uutils coreutils as one multicall binary, and a copy of
    /usr/bin/sleep under any other name exits 1 with "coreutils: unknown
    program 'startplasma-x11'". A test that copied `sleep` therefore skipped
    itself on this distribution and proved nothing. Blocking on a pipe this
    process holds open is also the safer lifetime: there is no timer to
    outlive, and a stand-in whose test died gets EOF and exits by itself.

    Use it as a context manager, or addCleanup(l.stop). It skips the test if
