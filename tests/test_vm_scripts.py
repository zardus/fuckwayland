"""vm/*.sh: the parts that can be run without a rig, and the two that were wrong.

Nothing in this file boots a virtual machine.  `vm/` is five bash scripts and a
Python `vmctl`, and the interesting failures in them are not "the image did not
come up" -- they are a status that was thrown away, a parser that counted a head
that was not there, and (since the rig grew a second and a third distro) a
package-manager line that only one distribution would have accepted.  All of
those are reachable by slicing the shipped script and feeding it text, which is
what happens here; anything that needs the rig itself is gated on `VMCTL_LIVE`.

* `vm/build-iso-golden.sh` ran stage 2 down a pipeline (`$SSH ... | tee | sed`)
  and then read `$?`, which is `sed`'s and is 0 whatever ssh did.  Every stage-2
  failure -- ssh dropped, sudo refused the password, the guest rebooted under
  it -- was reported as `stage 2 did not finish (rc 0)`, and the real status was
  gone.  Fix 53: `rc=${PIPESTATUS[0]}`.
* `vm/selftest.sh` had two parsers for the same tool.  The `kde-x11)` one reads
  `kscreen-doctor -o` per output BLOCK, because Plasma 5.27 puts the state on
  the `Output:` line and 6.x on the indented lines under it; the `kde)` one was
  a `grep` over the `Output:` line alone, so on Wayland it counted a *disabled*
  head as present -- and the rig test that unplugs a head and counts what is
  left was the one asking.  Fix 54: one parser for both.
* `vm/build-image.sh` was apt from top to bottom (DEBIAN_FRONTEND, debconf,
  netplan, snap, `dpkg-query -W`) with one `case` arm per desktop that also knew
  that desktop's display manager.  It is now three layers -- `pkg_*` per package
  manager, `dm_*` per display manager, `desktop_*` per desktop -- with a
  dispatch table naming every `DESKTOPS` key of `vm/vmctl` and nothing else.
  Each layer is sliced and run here against stubs.

The kscreen fixtures are synthetic, in the two shapes the comment in the script
describes.  The wlr-randr, hyprctl and cosmic-randr captures are real output;
tests/fixtures/vm/README.md says which tool, which version and where each was
recorded.
