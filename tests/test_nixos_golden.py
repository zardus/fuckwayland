"""vm/build-nixos-golden.sh: the third golden builder, sliced and run.

`vmctl build` overlays a cloud image and lets cloud-init dress it up;
`build-iso-golden.sh` drives the real Ubuntu installer off a release ISO.
Neither can make a NixOS golden: NixOS publishes no cloud image (the 26.05
release directory holds two ISOs, nixexprs.tar.xz and nothing else), runs no
cloud-init, and has no unattended installer to answer -- what it has instead
is a configuration [recon2/nixos §7.1].  So the flavor is
vm/nixos/{flake.nix,common.nix,<flavor>.nix} and the builder is `nix build`
plus three pieces of bookkeeping, and it is those three that are tested here:

* the root ssh key.  Every other flavor gets it through the cloud-init seed;
  this image has to have it baked in, so the build reads it from
  $VMDATA/keys/id_ed25519.pub and refuses in one line when it is not there.
  A 4.9 GiB image nobody can ssh into is the failure this prevents.
* the image's file name, which is `image.filePath` and carries the nixpkgs
  label -- the recon's was ...-26.05.20260907.93108a5-x86_64-linux.qcow2
  [recon2/nixos §7.4].  Hard-coding it is a builder that breaks on the next
  channel bump, so the script must read the attribute.
* the packages file.  vm/reference/<flavor>-packages.txt is a dpkg list for
  every other flavor and a store closure for this one; the conversion from
  `nix path-info -r` output to names is one sed and it has to be exact.

Nothing here builds an image or starts a VM (the nix build starts one of its
own inside the sandbox, which is why the script refuses to run beside a rig
instance -- also tested).
