// The decisions the overlap extension makes, with nothing to make them about:
// no gi, no compositor, no memory.  Everything in this file is a pure function
// of its arguments, which is why tests/test_gnome_overlap.py can run it under
// plain node and check it against the Python that already implements the same
// rules (wxrandr/monitors_xml.py), on a machine with no GNOME anywhere.
//
// extension.js does the parts that cannot be pure -- reading /proc/self/maps,
// copying bounded byte ranges, writing the two words -- and asks this file
// every question that has a right answer.

// -- which builds are known: THE TABLE ---------------------------------------
//
// generations.json, beside this file, is the whole of what is version-specific,
// and it is read rather than restated here: extension.js loads it (at call
// time, never at enable) and hands it to the functions below.  Adding a GNOME
// release is one record there, one record in GENERATIONS in
// wxrandr/gnome_overlap.py, and one run of gen-gir.py, which writes the .gir,
// the .typelib and metadata.json's shell-version out of the same file.  Tests
// hold the two records together field for field.
//
// An allowlist, deliberately: a wrong offset does not raise an error, it writes
// into the compositor's heap.  `--unsafe-gnome-overlap-unmeasured` is the one
// way past this particular gate and past nothing else; see forceGate() below.
//
// NOTHING HERE COMPUTES A NAME FROM A NUMBER, and that is the point of the
// rewrite.  Through GNOME 50 libmutter's API version was a counter of its own
// (46 -> libmutter-14, 50 -> libmutter-18), so `libmutter-${major - 32}.so.0`
// happened to work; mutter 51 sets libmutter_api_version to the GNOME major
// itself and ships libmutter-51.so.0 with Meta-51.typelib beside it.  A record
// spells the soname, the typelib version and the namespace out, so a generation
// whose names follow no scheme at all is still one record.

// ~/.config/monitors.xml, whose reader runs the validator this whole feature
// exists to get past, and which discards the entire file -- every other saved
// arrangement -- at every boot, for ever.  That is not hypothetical: it was
// measured happening on both releases, at a time when this check could not
// fire.
//
// The count, and not the dialog: gnome-shell 46 and 50 build their
// DisplayChangeDialog in windowManager.js and keep no reference to it anywhere
// a reader can find.  `Main.wm._displayChangeDialog`, which an earlier version
// of this check read, exists on neither -- so the check passed always, which is
// worse than having no check at all, because a check that cannot fire is
// believed.  What the dialog does do is take a modal grab, and `Main.modalCount`
// goes 0 -> 1 while it is up (measured, 46.0 and 50.1).  Other things take a
// modal grab too -- the overview, an open menu, the Alt+F2 dialog -- and
// refusing on those as well is the price of a check that does not depend on
// naming a dialog this shell will not name.
//
// It fails closed.  A count that is not a number is a refusal, so a shell that
// renames the field stops the feature instead of quietly disarming its most
// consequential guard.
//
// It has been measured refusing when nothing was on screen: once, on the first
// call after a post-update login on GNOME 46, with no dialog, no menu and no
// overview anywhere (screenshot checked), and the very next call seconds later
// applied normally.  A grab held for a moment while a session finishes coming
// up is not the thing this guard is for, but it is indistinguishable from it
// through `Main.modalCount`, and the cost of the two mistakes is not
// symmetrical: a false refusal costs one retry, a false pass costs
// ~/.config/monitors.xml for ever.  So the check was left exactly as strict as
// it was and the *message* was fixed, because what it said then -- answer the
// dialog -- named something the user could not see.  It now says the count, and
