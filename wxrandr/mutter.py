"""wxrandr GNOME backend: org.gnome.Mutter.DisplayConfig over fwcommon.dbus_mini.

Mutter (gnome-shell's compositor) has no zwlr_output_management; its display
API is the session-bus object /org/gnome/Mutter/DisplayConfig, callable by
any client on the user bus — no extension, no root:

- GetCurrentState() -> (serial, monitors, logical_monitors, properties). One
  monitor per connected connector (== the xrandr output; disabled ones
  included) with vendor/product/serial, mm sizes and its mode list — opaque
  mode ids ("1920x1080@60.000", "1920x1080i@59.940"), refresh as a double,
  is-current/is-preferred/is-interlaced flags and the per-mode list of
  supported scales. One logical monitor per enabled screen region: (x, y,
  scale, transform 0..7 (wl_output numbering; see MUTTER_RANDR_VIEW), primary,
  member monitors — several members == mirror). Sizes are never sent: the
  logical size is the mode size, swapped for 90/270, then in layout-mode 1
  (logical) roundf(px / scale) and in layout-mode 2 (physical — the GNOME 46
  default without "Fractional Scaling") the raw pixels. Read every time.
- ApplyMonitorsConfig(serial, method, logical_monitors, properties): the
  WHOLE layout in one call — atomic, exactly xrandr's model. method 0
  verifies only, 1 applies temporarily (xrandr semantics, no dialog), 2 also
  writes ~/.config/monitors.xml, after which gnome-shell asks "Keep changes?"
  for 20 s. Every connected monitor not listed is disabled. Mutter validates:
  exactly one primary, no overlap, every logical monitor edge-adjacent to
  another (a hole is "not adjacent"), min x = min y = 0, scale exactly one of
  the mode's supported scales, mirror members with identical modes, only mode
  ids it handed out (no custom modes). Rejections come back as D-Bus errors
  whose text is relayed verbatim after `xrandr: GNOME's Mutter refused this
  layout: ` -- Mutter's words, said in Mutter's name, because we never refuse
  a layout ourselves. Measured: with two monitors an overlap never produces
  "Logical monitors overlap"; adjacency is checked first and every layout
  that is not exactly edge-adjacent, overlap and gap alike, comes back
  "Logical monitors not adjacent". Nothing is half-applied.
- MonitorsChanged fires after a successful apply; the serial bumps on every
  change and a stale serial is AccessDenied: the state is re-read and the
  same plan re-sent once, but only when the monitors and layout it was built
  from are still what Mutter has (a serial bump alone); a hotplug or a
  concurrent re-layout in that window is "cancelled by a concurrent change".
- Holes: X tolerates a gap, Mutter does not, so an output that touched a
  neighbour's right/bottom edge keeps touching it when that edge moves
  (`--output A --rotate left` / `--mode SMALLER` / `-s` / `-o` in the middle of
  a row shift the outputs to its right along, one warning each) unless it
  was positioned explicitly in the same invocation (keep_adjacent). An
  output whose neighbour went `--off` is not moved: Mutter's own
  "not adjacent" is the answer, re-place it in the same call.
- GNOME 50 quirk (verified): after a temporary re-primary the old logical
  monitor keeps `primary=true` in GetCurrentState until it is rebuilt, so
  several may be flagged; the legacy GetResources output property
  `primary` tracks the real one (what XWayland and the shell use) and
  breaks the tie. The serial does not bump on temporary applies there.

Mapping to the wxrandr model (core.OutputState / core.Target):
    output name          connector          enabled  in some logical monitor
    x, y                 logical monitor x/y (its coordinate space)
    w, h                 derived (logical_size)   scale/transform  per region
    --same-as            one logical monitor with several members
    --primary            the primary flag (real; state.primary is synced)
    --brightness/--gamma no LUT API: warn + succeed
    --newmode/--addmode  state file as elsewhere; applying one needs a real
                         mode with the same size (and rate) -> `cannot find mode`
