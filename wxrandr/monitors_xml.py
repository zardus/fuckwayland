"""GNOME's saved display configuration (`~/.config/monitors.xml`): read it, judge it,
keep a copy of it.  Nothing here ever writes that file -- only Mutter does.

Mutter's writer and Mutter's reader do not agree, and the disagreement is expensive:

- The writer, `meta_monitor_config_manager_save_current()`, verifies nothing.  It
  serialises whatever configuration is current, which on GNOME-on-Xorg (and for anything
  that reaches libmutter behind DisplayConfig's back) can be a layout no validator ever
  saw.
- The reader verifies every `<configuration>` in the file with the same
  `meta_verify_logical_monitor_config_list()` the D-Bus call uses -- and one failure
  throws away *the whole file*, not the offending entry.  A file holds one entry per
  monitor set the user ever saved, so a single bad entry silently loses the lot, at
  every login, for ever.

wxrandr cannot land in that state itself: every layout we apply goes through
`ApplyMonitorsConfig`, which validates before anything is applied and long before
anything is written, and Mutter writes the file only after the user confirms its
"Keep changes?" dialog (measured on GNOME 46 and 50: nothing is written before the
confirmation, and rejected layouts leave the file byte-identical).  What we can do is
not be the tool that makes somebody else's damage permanent: a confirmed `--persistent`
apply rewrites the file from what Mutter holds in memory, which after a discarded read
is *only* the layout being applied.  So before every persistent apply wxrandr reads the
file, says so when Mutter has already discarded it, and -- once the apply is accepted --
keeps the previous bytes next to it in `monitors.xml.wxrandr-backup`.

GNOME keeps one generation of its own, `monitors.xml~` (glib writes it, as a side
effect of how Mutter replaces the file), and that is not the same thing: it is
overwritten by every save, GNOME Settings' saves included, so the copy of the file as
it stood before *this* apply is gone as soon as anything else writes one.  Ours is
written once per persistent apply and by nothing else.

Everything here is off the common path: a plain (temporary) apply never opens the file.

Whose file, though, is not always the caller's.  Run from `ssh root@box` or from cron
the process environment is root's -- `$HOME` is /root and `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, if it is
set at all, is root's -- while the session being reconfigured belongs to somebody else,
and Mutter reads that user's `~/.config/monitors.xml` and no other.  So `default_path()`
takes a uid, and with one that is not ours it resolves that account's `pw_dir` instead
of reading the environment.  The copy is then written into their home, and it has to
end up owned by them: a root-owned file in a user's config directory is one they cannot
replace and one their next `--persistent` cannot overwrite.  `keep_backup()` chowns it
to the owner of the file it copied, and when it cannot it removes the copy and says so
-- the one line this module prints, because it is also the only moment at which anyone
knows a backup was wanted and is not there.
