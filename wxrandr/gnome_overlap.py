"""`wxrandr --unsafe-gnome-overlap`: the one route to a GNOME layout in which two
monitors share screen area.

GNOME refuses such a layout, at one door and for no reason the rest of the
compositor needs -- `meta_verify_logical_monitor_config_list()` requires every
logical monitor to share an exact integer edge with another, and nothing else in
Mutter cares (docs/Technical.md section 6).  Every supported route in is closed:
`ApplyMonitorsConfig` validates on every method, and `~/.config/monitors.xml` is
worse than closed, because its reader runs the same validator and one failure
discards the whole file at every boot for ever.

What is left is a GNOME Shell extension that loads a type description of its own
for the symbols libmutter exports but does not introspect, and writes the new
positions into the configuration object before asking Mutter to apply it.  That
extension is `gnome/fuckwayland-overlap@fuckwayland`; this module is its client
and its gatekeeper.  The dangerous half is 8 bytes per monitor written inside
gnome-shell, and on Wayland a dead compositor is the whole session, so:

* **the flag is off, and its name is the warning.**  Nothing else in the CLI
  begins `--unsafe-`, and no xrandr manual page contains this string;
* **the ordinary layout never reaches any of it.**  The flag changes nothing
  unless the layout being applied is one Mutter's own validator refuses.  A
  request GNOME would take goes down the same DisplayConfig path it always did,
  and the extension is not even asked whether it is there;
* **it refuses on a compositor it does not recognise**, before it asks the
  extension anything, and the extension refuses again on its own account.  That
  one refusal, and no other, can be forced past by somebody who knows their
  machine, with a second flag that names the GNOME in front of them:
  `--unsafe-gnome-overlap-unmeasured 52`.  See "forcing" below for what it
  skips, what it cannot skip and why the argument is not decoration;
* **the warning is printed before the call, in full,** on every invocation until it
  is agreed to -- once, deliberately, and only for the build the checks passed on;
  see "the agreement" at the foot of this file for why that changes what is
  printed and nothing else;
* **it can never write ~/.config/monitors.xml.**  `--persistent` and this flag
  are mutually exclusive here; the extension's type description does not declare
  Mutter's writer at all, and it reports the file's digest from before and after
  its work so the tool can say so rather than assume it.

There is no confirmation prompt on the command line, deliberately.  See
`warning()`; warandr's dialog is the other half, and it too can only ever record
the agreement below.

#: THE TABLE.  One record per GNOME generation whose private

#:
#: It is the same table as
#: `gnome/fuckwayland-overlap@fuckwayland/generations.json`, which is what the
#: extension itself reads; `tests/test_overlap_force.py` proves the two
#: identical, field for field, and names the file to fix when they are not.
#: Two copies rather than one because the extension is installed into
#: `~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions` and wxrandr is installed into a venv
#: or a .deb, and neither can read the other's files at runtime.
#:
#: EVERY NAME IS WRITTEN OUT, none is computed.  Through GNOME 50 libmutter's
#: API version was a counter of its own -- 46 carried libmutter-14, 50 carried
#: libmutter-18 -- and code that spelled `libmutter-%d.so.0 % (major - 32)`
#: worked by accident of that arithmetic.  mutter 51 sets
#: `libmutter_api_version = '51'` (meson.build, line 10 of the 51~rc tarball),
#: so the next Ubuntu ships `libmutter-51.so.0` with `Meta-51.typelib` beside it
#: and the arithmetic is gone.  A generation whose names follow no scheme at all
#: is still exactly one record.
