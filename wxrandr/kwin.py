"""wxrandr KDE backend: kde_output_device_v2 + kde_output_management_v2 over
w11common.wayland_mini.

KWin has no zwlr_output_management and no D-Bus display API (org.kde.KWin
exposes activeOutputName() and nothing else; Plasma 5.27's org.kde.KScreen can
only replay the Meta+P presets). The one usable mechanism is the Wayland
protocol pair from plasma-wayland-protocols -- NOT from the kwin repo --
`kde_output_device_v2` (read) and `kde_output_management_v2` (write). It is
what kscreen-doctor and the System Settings KCM drive through libkscreen, and
it is unauthenticated: no portal, no polkit, no security-context check, so any
client holding the Wayland socket can use it (KWinDisplay::allowInterface
blacklists plasma_window_management, fake_input, screencast, ... and never
kde_output_*).

- Discovery has two shapes. Through Plasma 6.6 every output is a
  `kde_output_device_v2` wl_registry global (find them all -- find_global()
  returns only the first). **Plasma 6.7.0** is where that stopped: kwin commit
  7e32e00c, "wayland: Don't advertise kde-output-device-v2 globals anymore"
  (Vlad Zahorodnii, 2026-03-05, alongside 67f58528 "Implement
  kde-output-device-v2 v21"), first released in v6.7.0 and never backported --
  v6.6.6, cut four months later, still does
  `new OutputDeviceV2Interface(m_display, output)`, while v6.7.0's
  wayland_server.cpp constructs only `m_outputDeviceRegistry` and answers a
  hotplug with `m_outputDeviceRegistry->offer(output)`. From there the devices
  arrive as new_ids on `kde_output_device_registry_v2`, which the compositor
  refuses below v21:

      // OutputDeviceRegistryV2Private::..._bind_resource()
      if (resource->version() < 21) {
          wl_resource_post_error(resource->handle,
                                 error_unsupported_version,
                                 "unsupported version");

  and whose device resources take *the version the registry itself was bound
  at* -- `offer(target->client(), target->version(), ...)` ->
  `wl_resource_create(client, &kde_output_device_v2_interface, version, 0)`,
  the trailing 0 being what puts the id in the server's 0xff000000 range.
  There is no second bind and no separate device version to negotiate. Both
  paths are implemented; past that, the device object behaves identically
  either way, and the whole burst still lands inside the registry bind
  (`d->add(resource)` runs `kde_output_device_v2_bind_resource`, which sends
  geometry .. done synchronously), so one roundtrip publishes everything.
  Measured on KWin 6.7.4 (Ubuntu 26.10): `kde_output_device_v2` is not in
  wl_registry at all there, the registry is advertised at 23 and management at
  21, and query / mode / position / rotate / scale / --off / --primary /
  --same-as and a head plugged and unplugged all behave as on 6.6. An unplug
  on this path is the device's own `removed`, not a global going away.
- Versions move fast. KWin's own `s_version` per release, device / management:
  5.27 = 2/3, 6.0 = 6/7, 6.3 = 11/12, 6.4 and 6.5 = 16/16, 6.6 = 20/19,
  **6.7 = 23/21**, master = 25/22; the registry global shares the device's
  number (23 on 6.7.x, 25 on master). We bind LOW -- device 2 (the
  `name` event, i.e. the connector name, is since 2) and management
  min(advertised, 12) (`set_primary_output` is since 2, `failure_reason` since
  12) -- because a server only sends events whose `since` is <= the bound
  version, so binding low is the compatible choice and every field xrandr
  needs exists at device 2. Optional features are gated on the *bound*
  version, never assumed: on 5.27 a rejection carries no reason string at all.
  The registry is the exception that cannot be bound low: below 21 it is a
  fatal protocol error, so REG_MIN is a floor and not a preference.
- Modes are objects, like wlroots: `mode` is a server-allocated new_id whose
  own events carry size (hardware pixels, pre-transform, pre-scale) and
  refresh (mHz). We read the id off the wire and register a handler for it,
  and remember the object per Mode so apply can name it. There is no
  width/height/refresh form of the request.
- `done` is the atomic publish barrier: a device's fields are only visible to
  the snapshot once its `done` arrives.
- Coordinates are LOGICAL and the position is NOT scaled (output.cpp:637:
  `RectF(logicalPosition, transform.map(QSizeF(modeSize)) / scale)`, rounded
  only in geometry()). The logical size is therefore the transform-swapped
  mode size divided by the scale -- never core.logical_size's wlroots
  truncation -- but *how* that float becomes an integer changed with Plasma
  6: 5.27 rounds (1920 at 1.4 -> 1371, Mutter's layout-mode-1 rule) while
  6.6 takes the enclosing integer (1920 at 1.4 -> 1372, 1280 at 1.5 -> 854),
  both measured against the compositor's own geometry. Getting it wrong
  costs a one-pixel overlap KWin silently keeps, so the rule is gated on the
  advertised management version (>= 7 is Plasma 6).
- Scale is quantised server-side to 1/120 (`std::round(s * 120) / 120`) and a
  scale <= 0 is dropped silently. We quantise on both sides so the round trip
  is stable, and we marshal the wl_fixed ourselves as a plain int: wayland_mini
  `_marshal`'s "f" truncates, and it is shared with the wlroots path where
  changing it would change live sway behaviour (1.3 -> 1.296875).
- Apply is atomic and STRICTLY one-shot: a second `apply` on the same
  configuration object is a fatal `already_applied` protocol error that kills
  the connection, so every attempt builds a fresh configuration. A hotplug
  between create_configuration and apply silently invalidates the object (all
  setters become no-ops and apply answers "One of the relevant outputs is no
  longer available"); that one message is retried once from a fresh snapshot.
- Only deltas are sent. libkscreen compares every field first and skips the
  call entirely when nothing differs, and so do we: a no-op changeset still
  goes through Workspace::applyOutputConfiguration and still causes a modeset.
- KWin validates at apply: every ENABLED output needs x >= 0 and y >= 0
  ("Position of enabled output %1 is negative"), you may not disable every
  output, and an output may not mirror itself. The XML's "no gaps or overlaps"
  sentence is not enforced by the code, so xrandr's gaps and every overlap
  survive -- measured on Plasma 6 at two overlap widths: KWin takes the
  geometry and renders each output as a view onto one shared scene, so the
  shared region comes out byte-identical on both heads. We normalise the
  layout to the origin before sending and refuse the last-output disable
  client-side, with our own xrandr-shaped message; every rejection KWin does
  send is relayed in KWin's name.
- `--same-as` is a shared position for as long as a shared position is the
  mirror, and `set_replication_source` (management request 23, since v13) only
  where it is not. Measured on KWin 6.6: two outputs at one position are
  byte-identical (AE 0) when their pending LOGICAL rectangles coincide -- at
  equal size, and at different refresh rates alike -- because KWin draws every
  output as a view onto one shared scene. When the rectangles differ the
  smaller output shows a *crop* of the bigger one's scene, not a copy of it:
  at 1280x1024 against 1920x1080 it is exactly the top-left crop (AE 0 against
  that crop), at scale 2 it is the top-left quarter magnified, and rotated 90
  it is the leftmost 1080 columns turned on their side. Replication is what
  turns those into a copy: KWin fits the source's whole image into the
  replica's panel, aspect preserved and centred -- scale
  min(dst_w/src_w, dst_h/src_h) * src_scale, offset
  (dst_px - src_px / src_scale * dst_scale) / 2, measured to the pixel in both
  directions (96-row letterbox at 1024x768, first lit column 285 at 1920x1080)
  -- and the requested scale is overridden outright, so the clone comes out
  byte-identical where the sizes allow it. So the rectangles differing is the
  whole trigger and nothing else is: not the refresh rate, not `--same-as`
  itself. The rectangle compared against is the one the SCENE comes from,
  which is not always the output `--same-as` named -- see the chain below.
- A replicated output stops being a layout member: its `wl_output` global goes
  away, it leaves `kde_output_order_v1` (so it can never be the primary --
  set_priority on it is accepted and changes nothing), and it contributes
  nothing to the desktop bounding box. What the pair occupies is the SOURCE's
  rectangle, so that is what --query reports for the replica and what every
  relation measures from: measured with the replica's own panel size instead,
  `--right-of` a 1280x1024 replica of a 1920x1080 output landed the neighbour
  at x=1280, 640 px inside its source. Its own mode and transform still count
  (they are the panel the copy is fitted onto); its own position and scale are
  inert but still stored, and come back the moment the mirror ends. Clearing
  the source (the empty string) restores it completely, and so does disabling
  the source -- which is why the position we send for a replica is the one the
  query reports, the rectangle it comes back to.
- KWin will not copy a copy. A source that is itself replicating is accepted,
  stored and persisted, takes the output out of the layout like any other
  replication -- and is then painted never: measured, the panel kept its last
  frame byte-for-byte across a window move that repainted every other head,
  and two outputs replicating each other left `kde_output_order_v1` with
  neither of them in it. So `--same-as` resolves the source through the chain
  to the output whose scene it really shows and replicates that (a second
  replica letterboxes the same picture, which is the answer the user asked
  for); a chain that comes back to the output itself is nothing to replicate
  (`--same-as` the output that mirrors you is a shared position, and cannot
  build a loop); and a loop somebody else left is refused by name.
- Mirroring an output onto itself is KWin's own `failed` ("An output cannot
  mirror itself"); a uuid naming no enabled output is accepted
  and silently does nothing, so the source uuid always comes from a fresh
  snapshot. The replication source is persisted like everything else, as
  `replicationSource` in ~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json.
- There is no temporary mode and no confirmation dialog. KWin persists every
  applied configuration itself (Plasma 6: OutputConfigurationStore::storeConfig
  -> ~/.config/kwinoutputconfig.json, marked Source::User; 5.27: kded5 kscreen
  watches the same libkscreen ConfigMonitor and writes
  ~/.local/share/kscreen/<hash>). The 15-second "Keep these settings?"
  countdown lives in the System Settings KCM, not in KWin. So --persistent is
  the only mode there is: we say so once per apply and print the command that
  restores the pre-apply snapshot.

        IS the clone -- which it is exactly when the two pending logical rectangles coincide -- and

        The rectangle compared against is the one the *scene* comes from. An output that is itself mirroring

        the chain to its root and replicates that, which is also what makes a mirror of a mirror come out right,
        and it can never build a loop: a chain that comes back to the output itself means the output already
        shows that scene, so a shared position is all it takes.

        The replication source is touched only for an output this invocation *positions* (a relation or a
