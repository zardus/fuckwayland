# The .deb's payload, as nix outputs.
#
# One derivation shipped everything until now: `packages.default` was a
# buildPythonApplication with gobject-introspection, wrapGAppsHook3, gtk3 and
# pygobject3 in it, and its $out held the tools, five shadow symlinks and
# no share/ at all -- no extension, no udev rule, no warandr.desktop
# (measured: 546.2 MiB closure, 139 store paths, `find -maxdepth 4 -type d`
# naming only lib/python3.14/site-packages [recon2/pkg-nix §1]).  Two facts
# broke that arrangement:
#
#   * the four CLI clones are stdlib and import none of the GTK stack, which
#     is 330.9 MiB of the closure: the same source without
#     gobject-introspection/wrapGAppsHook3/gtk3/pygobject3 measures 215.1 MiB
#     against 546.2 with [recon2/nixos §8], and the split built here comes out
#     at 216.0 MiB for packages.w11 and 546.9 for packages.warandr
#     (`nix path-info -Sh`, 2026-09-08).  Only warandr needs `gi`.
#   * the five shadow symlinks made `packages.default` collide with
#     xdotool/xorg.xprop/xorg.xrandr/arandr in environment.systemPackages.
#     system-path builds with ignoreCollisions = true, so nothing fails --
#     the ORIGINALS win silently, and /run/current-system/sw/bin/xdotool
#     resolved to xdotool-3.20211022.1 on a Wayland session [recon2/nixos].
#     They are their own package now, and `programs.w11.shadowOriginals`
#     is the lib.hiPrio that makes them win on purpose.
#
# Everything here is derived from `src`: the extensions, the udev rule and the
# .desktop file are the tree's own bytes, never a second copy carried in nix/.
