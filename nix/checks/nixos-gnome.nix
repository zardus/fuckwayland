# `nix flake check` on GNOME 50.4, with nothing but the module.
#
# The recon built this machine by hand out of the four things a module would
# set -- the extension package in systemPackages, the dconf profile, the udev
# package, boot.kernelModules -- and it passed in 110.8 s of test script
# [recon2/pkg-nix §7, recon2/pkg-nix/gnometest.nix].  Here those four lines
# are `programs.w11.enable = true` and the prints are assertions.  It
# is the file that proves nixosModules.default, so it asserts the two things
# only a VM can say: that a store-installed extension is found and loaded with
# no ~/.local/share copy and no relogin, and that the uaccess rule reaches
# /dev/uinput through services.udev.packages.

    # created, written and destroyed inside one process lifetime, then picked
    # up by logind/libinput and handed to Mutter -- is not instant, and
    # wdotool/uinput.py has no settle wait between UI_DEV_CREATE and the
    # first event (grep: no sleep in that file at all).  wlroots wins the

    # delivery and this one cannot.  Asserting it here would be a flake, and
