"""zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1: move, click and scroll with no kernel device.

WHY THIS EXISTS. `vkbd.py` took the keyboard half of wdotool off /dev/uinput
on wlroots, and could take nothing else: zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1 has four
requests -- keymap, key, modifiers, destroy -- and not one of them is a
pointer. wlroots ships the other half as a separate, equally unprivileged
protocol, and this is it. With both, `click`, `mousemove`,
`mousemove_relative`, `mousedown` and `mouseup` need no root, no group
membership and no device rule on sway and the wlroots family, exactly as
typing already does not.

WHO HAS IT. sway 1.11 advertises `zwlr_virtual_pointer_manager_v1` at v2 to
every client and restricts it to none: an ordinary session user creates a
pointer and drives it, and root reaching the same socket gets the identical
registry. Mutter and KWin implement neither this nor the keyboard protocol,
so GNOME and KDE keep the kernel devices and every word of this file is
inert there.

FOUR THINGS THE WIRE DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM uinput, all measured on sway
1.11 / wlroots 0.19.2 against a three-head layout (one head at a negative
origin, one at scale 1.5):

* **Absolute motion is a ratio over the whole output layout.**
  `motion_absolute(time, x, y, x_extent, y_extent)` places the cursor at
  `x/x_extent` of the layout bounding box, in *logical* coordinates -- not
  pixels, and not one output. Extents of 2, 100, 65535 and 1000000 all land
  the same point. So the forward map is the identity: `x = target - bbox_x`
  with `x_extent = bbox_w`, which landed 14 of 14 targets with 0.000 error.
  There is no axis quantisation here at all, which is why the kernel path's
  ceiling map (B7) and its unchanged-EV_ABS nudge (B2) have no counterpart
  below -- and no way to reintroduce the off-by-one they exist to fix.
* **Relative motion is exact.** A virtual pointer is not a libinput device
  (sway lists it with an empty libinput configuration), so `pointer_accel`
  and `accel_profile` cannot apply to it on any wlroots compositor. 1, 10,
  100, 500 and 1000 each moved exactly that many logical pixels, and 500
  separate one-pixel motions moved exactly 500. On the same seat a
  /dev/uinput mouse asked for 500 units of REL_X moved the cursor 858.33 --
  which is B1, and it cannot come back on this path.
* **Buttons are refcounted per seat.** press, press delivers ONE press;
  release, release delivers the up on the *second* release. The kernel
  drops a duplicate instead, so the daemon sends neither: it presses only
  what it is not already holding and releases only what it is, which makes
  the two paths behave identically and keeps `held` honest.
* **Scroll signs are Wayland's, not evdev's.** Positive vertical is scroll
  *down*, so wdotool's wheel buttons map 4 -> axis 0 negative, 5 -> axis 0
  positive, 6 -> axis 1 negative, 7 -> axis 1 positive (WHEEL below). Axis
  events are also *buffered until `frame()`* -- motion is applied without
  one but the receiving client then never sees `wl_pointer.frame` -- so
  every request here ends in a frame.

WHAT IS NOT DONE HERE YET: saying where the pointer is.
`zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` has no events at all; zero arrive on the object
across motion, buttons and axes, and sway's IPC carries no cursor position
either. So the daemon's `getmouselocation` reports the position it put the
pointer at -- which on this path is exact, because the absolute map above
has no error -- and refuses to answer at all when it has not moved it. See
`daemon.POINTER_UNKNOWN`.

`xdotool getmouselocation` always answers, so this is a gap of ours and
gets a route. Two reach it. A wlr-layer-shell overlay is a protocol every
compositor in this family already speaks (AGENTS.md route 1) and its
`wl_pointer.motion` is the cursor, at the cost of a surface that eats the
events it reads -- it has to be unmapped again before the user's next
click. evdev is the other (route 4): integrate REL_X/REL_Y off
/dev/input, at the cost of read access to the devices and an anchor to
count from, since the kernel says how far the pointer moved and never
where it is.

LIFETIME is the keyboard's exactly: a held button does not survive the
client disconnecting (the release is delivered the instant the holder
exits), `destroy` releases too, and nothing survives a compositor restart --
which the client learns as a BrokenPipeError on its next write, an OSError,
which is the shape `_send` catches. Hence: ONE connection and ONE pointer
object for the life of anything held down.
