"""GNOME Shell (Mutter) window backend over the fuckwayland bridge extension.

GNOME has no window-management protocol and gnome-shell's own D-Bus surface
is either read-only and sender-allowlisted (org.gnome.Shell.Introspect) or
off by default (org.gnome.Shell.Eval outside "unsafe mode"). The only
supported way in is code running inside the shell: gnome/fuckwayland-bridge@
fuckwayland (see gnome/README.md) exports Mutter's window/workspace/monitor
facts and actions on the session bus as

    name  org.fuckwayland.Bridge   path /org/fuckwayland/Bridge
    iface org.fuckwayland.Bridge1  (JSON strings for structured results)

and this module is a thin client for it over dbus_mini (pure stdlib, one
connection per process, no gdbus spawns). Window ids are Meta.Window.get_id()
(64-bit, stable for the shell's lifetime -- the same numbers
org.gnome.Shell.Introspect uses), printed in decimal like every backend.

Field mapping (bridge object -> Window):
  class_   wm_class, else gtk_app_id, else sandboxed_app_id (Mutter reports
           the Wayland app_id as wm_class for native clients)
  instance wm_class_instance -- the WM_CLASS *instance* of an XWayland client
           (`xterm -name myinst` -> "myinst"), "" for native toplevels, where
           `search --classname` then falls back to class_ = the app_id
  x,y,w,h  get_frame_rect(): logical pixels, SSD frame included, no CSD
           shadow -- the same space the input daemon's pointer lives in
  focused  has_focus()
  visible  not hidden (minimized / show-desktop) AND on the active workspace
           -- X11's IsViewable; `is_mapped` is the looser "not minimized" so
           windowmap --sync does not hang on windows parked elsewhere
  desktop  workspace index, -1 when on all workspaces (sticky)

list() order is Mutter's stacking order bottom->top, so backend.hit_test()
picks hits[-1] = topmost; it also skips the DESKTOP/DOCK layers (desktop
icons, docks) window_type names, like a click-through X11 root window would.

When the bridge name is missing but org.gnome.Shell is on the bus, the
constructor fails with a diagnosis: screen locked, extension disabled or
broken, or the one-line install hint (_HINT). Only with WDOTOOL_GNOME_AUTOLOAD
set (to anything but 0) does it first try to load the installed extension
through org.gnome.Shell.Eval, which works only while the shell is in unsafe
mode; the default path -- the common "installed, needs a re-login" case --
never probes that privileged interface."""
