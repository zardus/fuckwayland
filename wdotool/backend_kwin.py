"""KWin window backend: one generated KWin script per command, over dbus_mini.

Nothing has to be installed for the user here (unlike the GNOME bridge):
`org.kde.kwin.Scripting.loadScript()` is plain Q_SCRIPTABLE on /Scripting with
no polkit action and no bus policy on Plasma 5.27 and 6 alike, so any client on
the session bus may push JavaScript into KWin. The script (wdotool.kwin_js)
cannot register a D-Bus object or return a value, so it answers with the JS
global callDBus() to a name *we* own:

    name  org.w11.KWin   path /org/w11/KWin
    iface org.w11.KWin1  members Result(s token, s json),
                                Event(s token, s uuid, s change)

Wire sequence per command (four round trips, one temp file):

    id = loadScript(file, "wdotool-<pid>-<seq>-<rand>")   /Scripting
    run()                                   /Scripting/Script<id> (6)
                                            /<id>                 (5.27)
    unloadScript("wdotool-<pid>-<seq>-<rand>")            /Scripting, finally

`Script::run()` is a *delayed* D-Bus reply: KWin sends it only after the file
has been read and QJSEngine::evaluate() has returned, and the script's own
callDBus() rides the same connection during evaluate(). D-Bus preserves
per-connection order, so the payload is already in our receive queue when run()
returns -- no dbus-monitor, no sleep. We still wait with a deadline rather than
assuming it (a script that throws before _ret, a syntax error, KWin refusing
the file: all of them look like silence).

Each call gets its own pluginName (KWin returns -1 for a name that is already
loaded, and reuses script *ids* as soon as a script is destroyed, so a shared
name would eventually drive somebody else's script) and its own token (a stale
payload from an earlier, timed-out call must not be read as this call's
answer). The name carries random bytes as well as the pid and a counter: KWin
keeps a name reserved for as long as the script object lives and loaded
scripts cannot be enumerated, so a wdotool killed between loadScript and
unloadScript leaks its name for the rest of the session -- with the pid alone
the next process to be given that pid would fail on its very first command,
for ever.

Window identity: KWin's only stable handle is `internalId`, a UUID string, and
the scripting API takes nothing else. wdotool prints numeric ids, so one is
minted from the uuid (see _wid: 30 bits of it, in a range Xwayland never hands
a client) and `self._uuids` maps it back; a miss re-reads the window list. Two
uuids colliding in those 30 bits is a one-in-a-million session, and _id_map
re-mints the second window rather than dropping it out of the listing.
`visible` = not minimized, not hidden and on the current desktop (X11's
IsViewable), like the GNOME backend.

No script at all for: the current desktop and the desktop count
(org.kde.KWin.currentDesktop / VirtualDesktopManager.count), the workspace list
(VirtualDesktopManager.desktops), show-desktop, and select_window() --
org.kde.KWin.queryWindowInfo() *is* xdotool's selectwindow, KWin's own
interactive window picker, answering with a map that carries the uuid.

Titles are `captionNormal` on 6 and `caption` with KWin's " <2>" duplicate-
title suffix stripped on 5.27 (which has no captionNormal property), so the
same window is named the same on both, and the same as X names it.

Capability gaps, all documented in docs/WDOTOOL.md: Plasma 6 removed window shading
(SHADED is a gap there, works on 5.27), neither release has a per-window
lower -- lowering a window that is not active falls back to keep-below -- and
KWin caps the number of virtual desktops (20 on 5.27, 25 on 6), which
set_num_desktops reports rather than looping against.
