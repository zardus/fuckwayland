"""Reverse keymap: which key produces a character under the ACTIVE layout.

We inject evdev keycodes through a virtual keyboard, and the compositor
interprets them through whatever XKB layout the session has active. The fixed
US-QWERTY table in `keymap.py` is therefore only right when the active layout
*is* US: under `de`, `fr` or Dvorak even plain ASCII comes out wrong. X11's
answer (rebind a spare keycode to the wanted keysym) has no Wayland
equivalent, and Mutter does not implement zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1, so the only
route left is to reverse the lookup: read the compositor's keymap, find the
key + modifiers that produce the character, and press *that*.

Every Wayland client is handed the full keymap as a file descriptor on
`wl_keyboard.keymap`, so `fetch()` binds the seat, takes the keyboard and
reads the fd — no protocol extension, no privileges, nothing to install.

*Which* of that keymap's groups is active is the one thing the protocol keeps
from us: `wl_keyboard.modifiers` carries it and reaches only the window with
keyboard focus. sway sends it anyway; KWin answers the same question on the
session bus (see `KwinLayouts`) and GNOME publishes it as a setting the portal
serves (see `GnomeInputSources`); everywhere else the group is inferred, and
`Snapshot.group_known` says which of the two happened.

    snap = fetch()                               # text + active group
    if not active_group_is_plain_us(snap.text, snap.group):
        rmap = build(snap.text, snap.group)      # else: keep the US table
        rmap.lookup_char("é")  -> [(13, 0), (18, 0)]   # dead_acute, then e

Layout of this module:
  * fetch()                      Wayland: keymap text + active group
  * kwin_group()                 KDE: the active group, off the session bus
  * gnome_group()                GNOME: the active group, from its setting
  * desktop_group()              both of those, tried in turn
  * parse()                      keymap text -> Keymap (keycodes/types/groups)
  * build()                      Keymap + group -> ReverseMap
  * ReverseMap.lookup_char()     char -> [(evdev keycode, modifier mask)]
  * active_group_is_plain_us()   the US bypass check -- deliberately its own
                                 scanner, sharing no code with the parser

An entry is (evdev keycode, modifier mask) where the mask is made of the
MOD_* bits below, NOT an X11 modifier mask: what the caller has to *press* is
a key, and which key carries level three is itself a property of the layout
(`ReverseMap.mod_keys`).

# list the user configured -- and that list IS the keymap's group order, name
# for name (`getLayoutsList()`'s long name is character-for-character the
# keymap's `name[GroupN]`). So the active group is that index plus one, with
# nothing to translate.
#
# Measured on Plasma 6.6.6 and 5.27.12: the same object, the same members and
# the same meaning on both, tracking every way a user switches (the applet,
# setLayout, switchToNext/PreviousLayout, the global shortcut, and the chord
# pressed through wdotool itself) and, under per-window layouts, reporting the
# focused window's layout -- which is where our keystrokes land, so that is
# the answer we want. KDE truncates the configured list at four, which is
# XKB's MAX_GROUPS, so the index can never legitimately outrun the keymap.

#     one launched at it. NameHasOwner first; it activates nothing.
#

# /Layouts, a KWin that has gone away, an index that does not fit the keymap
# we just read. A layout wdotool cannot ask about is exactly the layout it

# GNOME: which layout is active, read from the setting the shell keeps
#
# Mutter tells an unfocused client no more than KWin does, but GNOME Shell
# keeps the answer in GSettings, and xdg-desktop-portal serves GSettings on
# the session bus -- `org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.ReadAll` with the
# namespace `org.gnome.desktop.input-sources`. Measured on GNOME 46.0 and
# 50.1, default installs, where `xdg-desktop-portal` and
# `xdg-desktop-portal-gnome` are both already there:
#
#   * `mru-sources` is the live truth: its head is the active source, written
#     on every switch by every means a user has -- the Super+Space shortcut,
#     the panel indicator's menu -- and it is what a login restores, so the
#     very first command of a fresh session can already be on the second
#     layout. It is `[]` only in a session that has never switched, and there
#     `sources[0]` is active.
#   * `current` is DEAD. `gsettings describe` ends "DEPRECATED: This key is
#     deprecated and ignored" on both generations, `dconf watch` across a
#     session of switching shows the shell writing only `mru-sources`, and
#     writing `current` switches nothing. Never read it.
#   * dconf itself is not readable over the bus at all: `ca.desrt.dconf`
#     publishes `Init`, `Change` and the `Notify` signal and no read method.
#     The portal is the only route, and it needs nothing installed and no new
#     dependency -- `fwcommon/dbus_mini.py` speaks it as it stands.
#
# Turning the source's index into a keymap group is one rule with one wrinkle.
# Mutter compiles the sources in order and ALWAYS appends its own `us` group
# after them, even when `us` is already a source (`us,de` -> `us, de, us`);
# that appended group is why a one-layout GNOME session looks exactly like a
# two-layout one from the keymap alone, and why the notice used to fire on
# every command of every non-US GNOME desktop. XKB allows four groups, so
# beyond three sources Mutter recompiles around whichever source is in use:
# with `de,fr,gr,ru,es` the keymap is `de, fr, gr, us` until Spanish is
# picked, and then it is `ru, es, us` with group 2 active. So the group is the
# source's index within its chunk of three, plus one -- `tests/fixtures/
# keymaps/five_es.xkb` is that keymap, captured.
#
# Two states are refused rather than answered, because there the setting
# describes no single live layout:
#
#   * `per-window` true (Settings > Keyboard > "Let each window use its own
#     layout"): measured with `mru-sources` saying German while a newly opened
#     window was on US.
#   * a `mru-sources` head that is no longer in `sources` -- the list was
#     edited under us.
#
# and so is a source that is not an `xkb` layout (an IBus engine), which is
# the one shape here that was never measured. Every refusal, and every failure
# of the read, returns None and leaves the caller with the guess and the
# notice it had before this existed.
