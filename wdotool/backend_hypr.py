"""Hyprland window backend over the compositor's own IPC (`wdotool/hypr_ipc.py`).

Detection used to land Hyprland on the generic wlroots floor, which is honest for reading and wrong about
three things that were measured on a live 0.53.3 [M recon2/hyprland.md §3]:

* ids shift under the caller's feet -- two foots listed as `0x000f4240`/`0x000f4241`, and closing the first
  renamed the survivor to `0x000f4240`;
* `windowminimize` was accepted and did nothing (`hyprctl` still said `mapped: 1 hidden: 0`) -- Hyprland has
  no minimize at all, so the floor's silent success was a lie;
* every geometry was the whole output where `hyprctl -j clients` had the real rectangle (`at: 22,61
  size: 1876,997`).

`hyprctl -j clients` publishes everything the protocol does not: `at`, `size`, `pid`, `class`, `initialClass`,
`workspace`, `monitor`, `floating`, `mapped`, `hidden`, `fullscreen`, `pinned`, `xwayland`, `focusHistoryID`
[M recon2/hyprland.md §2, the recorded fixture is tests/fixtures/hypr/clients.json].

Ids are minted from `address` with `backend.mint_id()` -- the KWin scheme, `0x40000000 | 30 bits` -- so they
are stable for the life of a window and identical in two processes reading the same session, and they sit
outside the range Xwayland hands out ((client << 21) | serial) so a minted id is never read as an X id in the
same listing. `stableId` is not the key: it is a decimal string on 0.56 [M recon2/arch.md] and does not exist
on 0.53 (it is absent from every row of the recorded fixture).

What Hyprland does not do yet is refused by name, with the reason and the rung of AGENTS.md's ladder that
would close it, which is the whole point of the backend replacing the floor: a refusal a script can read
beats a success that did not happen."""
