"""sway/i3 window backend over raw i3-ipc (no external tools).

Framing: b"i3-ipc" + u32 payload length + u32 message type + JSON payload. Window ids are sway node ids;
commands address nodes with [con_id=N]. Desktops are workspaces: xdotool desktop N == workspace number N+1.

Two dialects on one wire. i3 speaks the same protocol and this backend is what `FUCKWAYLAND_PASSTHROUGH=never`
reaches on an i3 box, where it used to call itself sway and get four things wrong [M recon2/i3.md §2b]:
`dialect()` asks GET_VERSION once (sway is 1.x, i3 has been 4.x since 2011) and the four differences below hang
off it -- ids, floating, pid, visible. Everything else is one code path."""
