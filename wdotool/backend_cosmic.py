"""COSMIC window backend: `ext_foreign_toplevel_list_v1` + the two `zcosmic_toplevel_*` protocols.

cosmic-comp publishes no `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1` at all, which is why every window command --
all of wwmctl, wxprop's native plane, every `wdotool window*` -- answered `no Wayland session found` on a
COSMIC session, with a sentence naming a protocol COSMIC is never going to have [M recon2/cosmic.md §2, §3].
The display half (`wxrandr`, `warandr`) already worked over `zwlr_output_manager_v1` v4, typing already
worked over `zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1`, and the screen-mirroring tool's `--check` already passed on
`ext_image_copy_capture_manager_v1`; this file is the window half and nothing else.

Everything here was driven by hand against a live cosmic-comp before it was written
(`recon2/cosmic/cosmic_probe.py`, `cosmic_act.py`): `set_maximized` came back as `state [0]`,
`unset_maximized` as `[]`, `activate` as `[2]`, the manager announced `capabilities [1,2,3,4,6]`, and the two
workspaces were named `1` and `2` with `coordinates` `[1]` and `[2]` [M cosmic.md §4]. Opcodes are read off
the XML saved at `recon2/cosmic/cosmic-toplevel-{info,management}-unstable-v1.xml`.

What the protocol does not carry, and what this backend therefore says instead of guessing:

* **No pid.** Neither `ext_foreign_toplevel_handle_v1` nor `zcosmic_toplevel_handle_v1` has one, so `pid` is
  0 and `kill` refuses with the default `no pid for window N`.
* **No move, resize, raise or lower.** `zcosmic_toplevel_manager_v1` has `set_rectangle` (a minimise-animation
  hint) and nothing else, so those four refuse per command, name the protocol, and say what would close the
  gap: a patched cosmic-comp, AGENTS.md route 6. Every refusal in this file carries that second half.
* **No numeric id.** `identifier` is 32 base62 characters, so ids are minted from it
  (`backend.mint_id`): 30 bits of blake2b under 0x40000000, stable across processes for the life of the
  window and out of Xwayland's id range, unlike the wlr floor's arrival order.
* **Geometry, sometimes.** The `geometry` event never arrived in the nested rig -- not in 4 s and not after a
  maximize -- because cosmic-comp sends it only alongside `output_enter` or on a change [M cosmic.md §4,
  R `toplevel_info.rs`: `(outputs_changed || geometry_changed)`]. Without it the listing falls back to the
  output rectangle, the way the wlr floor does, and sets `geometry_is_floor` rather than printing anything:
  `list()` runs on every window command, so a warning there is a warning on all of them."""
