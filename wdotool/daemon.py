"""Input-injection daemon + client.

The daemon owns the uinput devices (device creation costs ~600ms of compositor hotplug latency — paid once),
tracks the injected pointer position, and serves one JSON object per line on a unix socket. `{"ok":true,...}` or
`{"ok":false,"error":"..."}`; a response may carry `"warnings":[...]` which the client prints to its stderr.

The daemon owns the pointer *model* (px, py): the position it last injected. It is only a model -- REL events, a
physical mouse, or another daemon move the compositor's pointer behind its back -- so clients that can ask the
compositor for the real position (the GNOME bridge's GetPointer) push it back with the `seed_pointer` op before
a relative move (see B1/B6 in docs/WDOTOOL.md). Neither injection path can ask: `zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1` has no
events and sway's IPC carries no cursor position, so a daemon that has moved nothing refuses the `pointer` op
instead of inventing an answer.

There are two of everything below. Keys go to /dev/uinput or to zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1 (`vkbd.py`), the pointer
to /dev/uinput or to zwlr_virtual_pointer_v1 (`vptr.py`), by one policy stated once under "which devices
inject".

# The daemon deliberately outlives the command that spawned it: it pays for its uinput devices once (~600ms of
# compositor hotplug settle), and it keeps the compositor connections, the geometry and the keymap it has
# worked out, so the second command of a script costs a socket round trip instead of a second of setup. That
# is what it is for, and none of this is a timer on *using* wdotool. Two things end a daemon anyway, both
# checked once per _CHECK_SECONDS from the accept loop, both skipped while a client is connected:
#
# * **it can no longer be reached.** The socket is a name in $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, and logging out clears that
#   directory; a daemon whose socket file is gone can never be dialled again, by anybody, and it neither
#   notices nor exits. Measured on the test rig: 161 of them alive at once, ~3GB between them, sockets in
#   per-test runtime directories that had been deleted hours before, the oldest 18 hours old. The check
#   compares the socket file's *inode*, not its name, so it also catches the other way to become unreachable:
#   a second daemon having replaced the socket at the same path.
# * **nobody has used it for _IDLE_SECONDS.** Fifteen minutes, chosen from what the daemon is for: the gap it
#   has to sit through is the gap between two commands of one piece of work -- a script, a keybinding pressed
#   twice, a person moving a window by hand -- and those are seconds apart, not minutes. A quarter of an hour
#   is an order of magnitude past the longest of them, and the cost of being wrong is one respawn (~0.6s, paid
#   once, by the command that comes late). Left running instead, that daemon costs ~19MB, two compositor

    # -- modifiers around an injection (--clearmodifiers) ------------------
    #
    # xdotool's --clearmodifiers is "clear around the injection", not "clear
    # for good": X11 reads the modifier state, releases it, injects, and puts
    # back what was held. Through uinput that is possible for exactly the
    # modifiers *we* hold, and for no others. Two kernel facts decide it, both
    # measured on live GNOME, KDE and sway sessions:
    #
    #   * `input_handle_event()` drops an EV_KEY release for a code the
    #     emitting device does not have down. A key-up we send for a modifier
    #     the user holds on their own keyboard therefore produces no event at
    #     all -- not "the compositor ignored it": nothing reaches the wire. So
    #     a foreign modifier cannot be cleared from here.
    #   * a key-down we send *does* produce an event, and it stays ours until
    #     we release it. Mutter and KWin reference-count key state across the
    #     seat's devices, so the user letting go of the same modifier takes
    #     the count 2->1 and leaves it active -- for the rest of the session,
    #     because nothing else will ever send our release.
    #
    # Pressing back a modifier we did not hold is thus the worst of both: it
    # restores nothing (nothing was cleared) and it sticks. The restore set is
    # `self.down` -- what this daemon is holding -- sampled with no ioctl and
    # no re-read, so it cannot go stale: clear, inject and restore all happen
