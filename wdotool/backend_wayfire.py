"""Wayfire window backend over Wayfire's own JSON IPC (`plugins = ipc ipc-rules`).

Framing: a native-endian int32 length and a JSON body, both ways -- the recorded ping went out as the four
bytes `$\x00\x00\x00` followed by the 0x24-byte body `{"method": "stipc/ping", "data": {}}`
[M recon2/wayfire.md §1.2]. There is no message type and no magic, so a request is just its own method name.

Wayfire ships the IPC plugins in the base package and loads none of them by default: the stock plugin list
[M recon2/wayfire.md §1.1] carries `foreign-toplevel` but not `ipc`, so a stock Wayfire is a wlr-floor
compositor and the four tools land on `backend_wlr` there. What this backend buys over that floor is
everything the floor refuses: real geometry (the floor reported the output rectangle for every window),
pids, moving, resizing, lowering, desktops, `selectwindow` and the WM_CLASS *instance*
[M recon2/wayfire.md §2.3, §2.4].

Ids are the view's own `id` -- small, dense, and the shape sway's node ids have -- so nothing is minted here.

Desktops are Wayfire's 3x3 viewport grid per output, flattened `y * grid_width + x`
[M recon2/wayfire.md §1.2: `window-rules/list-outputs` carries `workspace {x, y, grid_width: 3,
grid_height: 3}`]. A view's geometry is expressed relative to the *current* viewport, not to the wset origin:
with the viewport at (1, 0), a view sitting on viewport (0, 0) of a 1280-wide output read back
`x: -882` (re-measured on this box against wayfire 0.10.0 headless), which is what the `_viewport()`
arithmetic below is for."""
