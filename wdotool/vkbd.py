"""zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1: type by uploading a keymap of our own.

WHY THIS EXISTS. The uinput path injects *keycodes* at the kernel input
layer, so the compositor reads them through whatever XKB layout the session
has active -- which is why `xkbmap.py` has to look every character up
backwards through the compositor's own keymap. This protocol is the answer
built for that problem: the client uploads its OWN keymap and sends keycodes
against it. Measured on sway 1.11/wlroots, with the session set to `de` and
our US keymap uploaded, evdev 21/44/16 arrive as `y z q` -- while the same
keycodes through /dev/uinput arrive as `z y q`. The compositor sends the
focused client our keymap ahead of our first key and the session's keymap
back when the real keyboard is next used: the seat keymap follows the active
device, so ours is authoritative for our keycodes.

WHAT IT IS NOT. Four requests -- keymap, key, modifiers, destroy. No pointer,
no buttons, no scroll, no window control; `click` and `mousemove` stay on the
kernel device. Mutter does not implement it, and neither does KWin 6.6.6
(measured: the string appears nowhere in Plasma's libraries, and the same
globals are advertised to root and to the session user), so the reverse map
in `xkbmap.py` stays exactly where it is for GNOME and KDE.

THREE THINGS THE WIRE DOES DIFFERENTLY FROM uinput, all measured:

* **Modifiers are not derived from our keycodes.** wlroots does not run a
  virtual keyboard's keys through xkb state: evdev 42 down, `y`, 42 up types
  `y`, and a focused observer sees the 42 events with no `modifiers` event at
  all. The client has to send the `modifiers` request itself. That is what
  `_MOD_BITS` and `VirtualKeyboard.key()` are for -- pressing a modifier
  keycode through this sink updates the depressed mask and sends it, so
  `key ctrl+shift+t` and a shifted character keep working unchanged in the
  callers.
* **Modifier state is per device.** A modifier physically held on the user's
  own keyboard does not reach our keys (uinput's cannot avoid it), and ours
  does not reach theirs. `--clearmodifiers` is therefore honest here: we can
  release exactly what we hold and say so with `modifiers(0,0,0,0)`.
* **The compositor releases what we hold when we disconnect.** A `keydown`
  from a process that exits produces one keypress and no repeat. So the
  daemon keeps ONE connection and ONE zwp_virtual_keyboard_v1 object for the
  life of anything held down -- which is exactly the shape the daemon already
  has.

THE KEYMAP. `us_keymap.TEXT`, a captured keymap, uploaded verbatim. A keymap
we synthesise ourselves compiles and then delivers no key events (twice, on
wlroots, unexplained) -- so nothing here builds one, and the built-in US
character table in `keymap.py` is right by construction because the keymap we
upload is the one that table was written for.
