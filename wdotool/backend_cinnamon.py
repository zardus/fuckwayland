"""Cinnamon (Muffin) window backend over org.Cinnamon.Eval.

Cinnamon is two targets wearing one name. The **X11 session** is the default everywhere and needs no backend
at all: it is a plain EWMH session and the tools hand over to the real xdotool/wmctrl/xprop, measured
byte-identical (`wwmctl -lGpx` against `wmctrl -lGpx` on a live Cinnamon 6.4.13) [M recon2/cinnamon.md §3.1].
This module is for the **Wayland session** (`cinnamon-wayland.desktop`, experimental through 6.6 and not
experimental from Cinnamon 6.8 / Mint 24), where before it every window command answered `no Wayland session
found` [M cinnamon.md §3.2].

Why Eval and not a protocol or an extension: muffin advertises 23 Wayland globals and not one of them is a
foreign-toplevel or output-management protocol, of either family [M cinnamon.md §2.1], and Cinnamon has no
window-listing D-Bus method (`org.Cinnamon` has `GetMonitors`, `Screenshot*`, `ShowOSD` and no windows)
[M cinnamon.md §2.2]. What it does have is `org.Cinnamon.Eval`, ungated -- so this is KWin's `loadScript`
shape: one JS program per operation, in wdotool/cinnamon_js.py, and nothing installed for the user.

That interface is also the honest thing to say out loud: `org.Cinnamon.Eval` grants arbitrary code execution
inside the shell to every client of the session bus, with no consent step, and it is there whether or not
this project exists. wdotool only uses what is already open.

Field mapping (the list program's record -> Window), each measured:
  id       get_stable_sequence() -- small and dense, X-id-shaped
  pid      get_pid(), falling back to get_client_pid() where the first is -1
           (native Wayland windows: measured `"pid":-1,"cpid":86275` on foot)
  x,y,w,h  get_frame_rect() -- the frame, which wwmctl's extents logic already
           reconciles with the client rect for a views() backend
  visible  not minimized AND on the active workspace (or sticky)
  desktop  workspace index, -1 for a window on all workspaces

Two things this backend does that the GNOME one does not have to:

* a resize of a native Wayland window is **asynchronous**. The same command chain read the old size back and
  the new one two seconds later [M cinnamon.md §4], so move and resize poll `get_frame_rect()` for up to
  `settle` seconds, the way GnomeBackend._wait_focused waits for focus.
* `events()` is polled. Eval has no signal route -- there is no way to register a D-Bus object from inside
  an Eval'd program -- so a `-spy` watcher diffs one list against the last every `POLL` seconds. Said out
  loud in docs/WDOTOOL.md: it is not the compositor telling us, it is us asking.

`x_info()` returns None on purpose: `global.display.get_x11_display()` does not exist in muffin (measured),
and it does not need to -- muffin writes `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/.mutter-Xwaylandauth.XXXXXX`, which is exactly
what w11common/session.py's cookie discovery already looks for [M cinnamon.md §2.3]."""
